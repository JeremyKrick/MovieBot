{"prompt": "Wow", "completion": "Let's go."}
{"prompt": "No", "completion": "Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie."}
{"prompt": "Like my fear of wearing pastels?", "completion": "I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this \"persona\"?  And you don't know how to quit?"}

{"prompt": "Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...", "completion": "I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually."}

{"prompt": "She's not a...", "completion": "Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies."}

{"prompt": "Forget French.", "completion": "How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.", "completion": "That's because it's such a nice one."}
{"prompt": "C'esc ma tete. This is my head", "completion": "Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz."}
{"prompt": "Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...", "completion": "Let me see what I can do."}

{"prompt": "Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?", "completion": "He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation."}

{"prompt": "You looked beautiful last night, you know.", "completion": "So did you"}
{"prompt": "Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.", "completion": "I guess I'll never know, will I?"}
{"prompt": "I guess I thought I was protecting you.", "completion": "God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself"}
{"prompt": "That's not", "completion": "I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes."}
{"prompt": "I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.", "completion": "No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage."}
{"prompt": "After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because \"everyone else\" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --", "completion": "Why didn't you tell me?"}
{"prompt": "Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.", "completion": "But"}

{"prompt": "I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .", "completion": "I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t."}
{"prompt": "Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.", "completion": "Like you care."}
{"prompt": "I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.", "completion": "You're welcome."}
{"prompt": "Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --", "completion": "I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now."}
{"prompt": "You are so completely unbalanced.", "completion": "Can we go now?"}
{"prompt": "It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?", "completion": "Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too."}
{"prompt": "At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.", "completion": "Like I'm supposed to know what that even means."}
{"prompt": "Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.", "completion": "Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?"}
{"prompt": "You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.", "completion": "What's normal?"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck."}
{"prompt": "It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.", "completion": "Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?"}
{"prompt": "Can you at least start wearing a bra?", "completion": "Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?"}
{"prompt": "Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.", "completion": "I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way."}
{"prompt": "I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.", "completion": "Where've you been?"}
{"prompt": "Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!", "completion": "I'm missing something."}
{"prompt": "He's not a \"hot rod\".  Whatever that is.", "completion": "You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story."}
{"prompt": "No, but", "completion": "It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?"}
{"prompt": "Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --", "completion": "The prom?  Kat has a date?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because she'll scare them away."}

{"prompt": "Wear the belly before you go.", "completion": "Daddy, no!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, God.  It's starting.", "completion": "It's just a party. Daddy."}

{"prompt": "Exactly my point", "completion": "Daddy, I --"}
{"prompt": "But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!", "completion": "But she doesn't want to date."}

{"prompt": "Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...", "completion": "No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion."}
{"prompt": "Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?", "completion": "Just sent 'em through."}
{"prompt": "Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?", "completion": "Never"}
{"prompt": "Always a pleasure, Brucie.", "completion": "Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?"}

{"prompt": "Extremely unfortunate maneuver.", "completion": "The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?"}
{"prompt": "You told me that part already.", "completion": "Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -"}
{"prompt": "Assail your ears for one night.", "completion": "It's her favorite band."}
{"prompt": "He's pretty!", "completion": "Okay!  I wasn't sure"}

{"prompt": "Will Bogey get bent?", "completion": "Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass."}
{"prompt": "This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.", "completion": "In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out."}
{"prompt": "You got him involved?", "completion": "Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca."}
{"prompt": "I thought you hated those people.", "completion": "Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street."}
{"prompt": "That's what I just said", "completion": "You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side."}
{"prompt": "Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?", "completion": "Did she actually say she'd go out with you?"}
{"prompt": "They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?", "completion": "I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers."}
{"prompt": "He seems like he thrives on danger", "completion": "No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz..."}
{"prompt": "You wanna go out with him?", "completion": "What makes you think he'll do it?"}
{"prompt": "Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?", "completion": "What about him?"}
{"prompt": "The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.", "completion": "I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.", "completion": "That's her?  Bianca's sister?"}
{"prompt": "You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?", "completion": "You could consecrate with her, my friend."}
{"prompt": "Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada", "completion": "Guess who just signed up for a tutor?"}
{"prompt": "Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.", "completion": "You know French?"}
{"prompt": "Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.", "completion": "He always have that shit-eating grin?"}

{"prompt": "So -- which Dakota you from?", "completion": "North, actually.  How'd you   ?"}
{"prompt": "So they tell me...", "completion": "C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour."}

{"prompt": "Yeah -- we'll see.", "completion": "What've you got for me?"}
{"prompt": "And why would I do that?", "completion": "And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way."}
{"prompt": "Your sister here?", "completion": "Leave my sister alone."}
{"prompt": "Where ya goin?", "completion": "Away."}
{"prompt": "Hey -- do you mind?", "completion": "Not at all"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.", "completion": "They're running the rest of me next month."}
{"prompt": "Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.", "completion": "The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?"}

{"prompt": "You just said", "completion": "You need money to take a girl out"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.", "completion": "Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it."}

{"prompt": "I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.

{"prompt": "I didn't care about the money.", "completion": "A Fender Strat. You bought this?"}
{"prompt": "It wasn't like that.", "completion": "Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?"}

I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story."}
