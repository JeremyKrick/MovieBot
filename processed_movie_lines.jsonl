{"prompt": "Wow", "completion": "Let's go."}
{"prompt": "No", "completion": "Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie."}
{"prompt": "Like my fear of wearing pastels?", "completion": "I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this \"persona\"?  And you don't know how to quit?"}

{"prompt": "Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...", "completion": "I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually."}

{"prompt": "She's not a...", "completion": "Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies."}

{"prompt": "Forget French.", "completion": "How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.", "completion": "That's because it's such a nice one."}
{"prompt": "C'esc ma tete. This is my head", "completion": "Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz."}
{"prompt": "Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...", "completion": "Let me see what I can do."}

{"prompt": "Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?", "completion": "He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation."}

{"prompt": "You looked beautiful last night, you know.", "completion": "So did you"}
{"prompt": "Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.", "completion": "I guess I'll never know, will I?"}
{"prompt": "I guess I thought I was protecting you.", "completion": "God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself"}
{"prompt": "That's not", "completion": "I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes."}
{"prompt": "I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.", "completion": "No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage."}
{"prompt": "After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because \"everyone else\" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --", "completion": "Why didn't you tell me?"}
{"prompt": "Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.", "completion": "But"}

{"prompt": "I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .", "completion": "I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t."}
{"prompt": "Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.", "completion": "Like you care."}
{"prompt": "I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.", "completion": "You're welcome."}
{"prompt": "Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --", "completion": "I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now."}
{"prompt": "You are so completely unbalanced.", "completion": "Can we go now?"}
{"prompt": "It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?", "completion": "Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too."}
{"prompt": "At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.", "completion": "Like I'm supposed to know what that even means."}
{"prompt": "Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.", "completion": "Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?"}
{"prompt": "You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.", "completion": "What's normal?"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck."}
{"prompt": "It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.", "completion": "Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?"}
{"prompt": "Can you at least start wearing a bra?", "completion": "Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?"}
{"prompt": "Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.", "completion": "I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way."}
{"prompt": "I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.", "completion": "Where've you been?"}
{"prompt": "Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!", "completion": "I'm missing something."}
{"prompt": "He's not a \"hot rod\".  Whatever that is.", "completion": "You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story."}
{"prompt": "No, but", "completion": "It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?"}
{"prompt": "Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --", "completion": "The prom?  Kat has a date?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because she'll scare them away."}

{"prompt": "Wear the belly before you go.", "completion": "Daddy, no!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, God.  It's starting.", "completion": "It's just a party. Daddy."}

{"prompt": "Exactly my point", "completion": "Daddy, I --"}
{"prompt": "But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!", "completion": "But she doesn't want to date."}

{"prompt": "Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...", "completion": "No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion."}
{"prompt": "Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?", "completion": "Just sent 'em through."}
{"prompt": "Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?", "completion": "Never"}
{"prompt": "Always a pleasure, Brucie.", "completion": "Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?"}

{"prompt": "Extremely unfortunate maneuver.", "completion": "The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?"}
{"prompt": "You told me that part already.", "completion": "Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -"}
{"prompt": "Assail your ears for one night.", "completion": "It's her favorite band."}
{"prompt": "He's pretty!", "completion": "Okay!  I wasn't sure"}

{"prompt": "Will Bogey get bent?", "completion": "Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass."}
{"prompt": "This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.", "completion": "In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out."}
{"prompt": "You got him involved?", "completion": "Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca."}
{"prompt": "I thought you hated those people.", "completion": "Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street."}
{"prompt": "That's what I just said", "completion": "You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side."}
{"prompt": "Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?", "completion": "Did she actually say she'd go out with you?"}
{"prompt": "They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?", "completion": "I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers."}
{"prompt": "He seems like he thrives on danger", "completion": "No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz..."}
{"prompt": "You wanna go out with him?", "completion": "What makes you think he'll do it?"}
{"prompt": "Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?", "completion": "What about him?"}
{"prompt": "The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.", "completion": "I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.", "completion": "That's her?  Bianca's sister?"}
{"prompt": "You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?", "completion": "You could consecrate with her, my friend."}
{"prompt": "Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada", "completion": "Guess who just signed up for a tutor?"}
{"prompt": "Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.", "completion": "You know French?"}
{"prompt": "Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.", "completion": "He always have that shit-eating grin?"}

{"prompt": "So -- which Dakota you from?", "completion": "North, actually.  How'd you   ?"}
{"prompt": "So they tell me...", "completion": "C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour."}

{"prompt": "Yeah -- we'll see.", "completion": "What've you got for me?"}
{"prompt": "And why would I do that?", "completion": "And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way."}
{"prompt": "Your sister here?", "completion": "Leave my sister alone."}
{"prompt": "Where ya goin?", "completion": "Away."}
{"prompt": "Hey -- do you mind?", "completion": "Not at all"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.", "completion": "They're running the rest of me next month."}
{"prompt": "Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.", "completion": "The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?"}

{"prompt": "You just said", "completion": "You need money to take a girl out"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.", "completion": "Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it."}

{"prompt": "I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.

{"prompt": "I didn't care about the money.", "completion": "A Fender Strat. You bought this?"}
{"prompt": "It wasn't like that.", "completion": "Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?"}

I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story."}

{"prompt": "You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.", "completion": "When I go?"}
{"prompt": "What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?", "completion": "No -- impressed."}
{"prompt": "The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.", "completion": "Bianca did what?"}

{"prompt": "The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...", "completion": "Tempestuous?"}
{"prompt": "Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.", "completion": "I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator."}
{"prompt": "Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.", "completion": "Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action."}

{"prompt": "Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.", "completion": "IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!"}
{"prompt": "Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?", "completion": "Blind faith is what I consider heresy!"}
{"prompt": "If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?", "completion": "Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?"}
{"prompt": "Is that all that interests you? Gold?", "completion": "No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God."}
{"prompt": "If they agree to follow me, yes.", "completion": "Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold."}
{"prompt": "Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.", "completion": "Your life, and that of others!"}
{"prompt": "Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.", "completion": "Excellency, you are right."}
{"prompt": "I am, Your Eminence", "completion": "Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable."}
{"prompt": "Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.", "completion": "Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?"}
{"prompt": "A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.", "completion": "You say Asia can be found by sailing west?"}
{"prompt": "You can see for yourself.", "completion": "What a tragedy... what a waste of a life..."}
{"prompt": "It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.", "completion": "On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross."}
{"prompt": "He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?", "completion": "Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain."}
{"prompt": "The Judgment is ours!", "completion": "Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography."}
{"prompt": "I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.", "completion": "The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence..."}
{"prompt": "I am busy inside.", "completion": "What is it, now?  Tell me..."}
{"prompt": "Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...", "completion": "Can't you stay with us a little?"}
{"prompt": "They tried... but I didn't let them.", "completion": "They took everything..."}
{"prompt": "I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.", "completion": "God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me..."}
{"prompt": "Beatrix, I want to ask you something.", "completion": "You don't usually ask."}

{"prompt": "I find that hard to believe.", "completion": "She said yes."}
{"prompt": "I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!", "completion": "Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman..."}
{"prompt": "Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...", "completion": "Are we going to argue?"}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "I haven't given you much of a life."}
{"prompt": "I am afraid this is not the worst news.", "completion": "I could be gone for years."}
{"prompt": "I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.", "completion": "How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would."}
{"prompt": "Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.", "completion": "How far from here?"}

{"prompt": "Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.", "completion": "I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?"}
{"prompt": "I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.", "completion": "Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet..."}
{"prompt": "He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.", "completion": "He never had one... except aboard my ships!"}
{"prompt": "I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.", "completion": "What does he say?"}
{"prompt": "There must be a passage to that other ocean.", "completion": "What are you listening to?"}
{"prompt": "Not bad.", "completion": "Father..."}
{"prompt": "This time with me!", "completion": "How are you feeling, Fernando?"}
{"prompt": "Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!", "completion": "I have to explore the mainland."}
{"prompt": "You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?", "completion": "Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?"}
{"prompt": "I want to go with you!", "completion": "There'll be a time."}
{"prompt": "Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...", "completion": "All of them created by people like me."}
{"prompt": "Look out of that window.", "completion": "What do you see?"}
{"prompt": "Call them.", "completion": "I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer."}
{"prompt": "To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.", "completion": "All I have to do is call the guards."}
{"prompt": "You seem to have a special talent for making friends.", "completion": "What...?  Do I have so many already?"}
{"prompt": "Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.", "completion": "Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!"}
{"prompt": "... for a commoner?", "completion": "But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration."}
{"prompt": "Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?", "completion": "You defend yourself admirably..."}
{"prompt": "If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.", "completion": "They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And..."}
{"prompt": "Then you are too ambitious.", "completion": "And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?"}
{"prompt": "I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.", "completion": "I'm not bargaining!"}
{"prompt": "No?", "completion": "NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!"}
{"prompt": "You never learned how to speak my language.", "completion": "No..."}
{"prompt": "You did the same to your God!", "completion": "Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me."}
{"prompt": "Ask him if he will help.", "completion": "You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!"}
{"prompt": "We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?", "completion": "He understands."}
{"prompt": "Chief says...", "completion": "He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people."}
{"prompt": "Chief says -- he has a God.", "completion": "... and also to bring medicine."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "To bring the word of God."}
{"prompt": "Chief says -- how many?", "completion": "Thousands."}
{"prompt": "Chief knows.", "completion": "Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort."}
{"prompt": "You come!  You speak first!", "completion": "Tell the Chief we thank him."}
{"prompt": "What is it?  A tribe?  An island?", "completion": "Island.  Far."}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!", "completion": "Say not here!  Cuba!"}
{"prompt": "New worlds create new people.", "completion": "Oh?  So you are a new man?"}
{"prompt": "I have to disagree.", "completion": "I knew you would."}
{"prompt": "I suppose we're both old men now.", "completion": "You'll always be older than me, Father."}
{"prompt": "I believed in you...", "completion": "Give me absolution."}
{"prompt": "My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.", "completion": "You are bound by an oath, Father."}
{"prompt": "May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!", "completion": "If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me..."}
{"prompt": "How long?", "completion": "I am not sure... It could be twice the distance."}
{"prompt": "What are you saying?", "completion": "I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said."}
{"prompt": "I am listening, my son.", "completion": "Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you."}
{"prompt": "In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.", "completion": "Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned."}
{"prompt": "All of them!  Just lies!", "completion": "Colon!  Don't!"}
{"prompt": "Colon!", "completion": "Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!"}
{"prompt": "If God intends you to go, then you will go.", "completion": "Damn God!"}
{"prompt": "You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.", "completion": "Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?"}
{"prompt": "I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!", "completion": "Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son."}
{"prompt": "Passion is something one cannot control!", "completion": "You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!"}
{"prompt": "I'll try to remember that, Marchena...", "completion": "Father Marchena!"}
{"prompt": "So was Christ!", "completion": "Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon."}
{"prompt": "The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...", "completion": "Esdras is a Jew."}
{"prompt": "Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.", "completion": "How can you be so certain?"}
{"prompt": "To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...", "completion": "How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite."}
{"prompt": "With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.", "completion": "Why do you wish to sail west?"}
{"prompt": "That's what it says.", "completion": "How did you manage it?"}
{"prompt": "Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.", "completion": "God... That's in a week!"}
{"prompt": "Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.", "completion": "Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers..."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?"}
{"prompt": "They come and go as naked as the day God created them...", "completion": "But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent."}
{"prompt": "Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?", "completion": "Do they have such thoughts?"}
{"prompt": "A woman?", "completion": "How old are you, Senor Colon?"}
{"prompt": "You show no inclination to speak otherwise!", "completion": "I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... \"What if?\"..."}
{"prompt": "Surely you can do anything you want.", "completion": "May I speak freely?"}
{"prompt": "That she was impregnable.", "completion": "I cannot ignore the verdict of my council."}
{"prompt": "The ocean is uncrossable?", "completion": "What did they say about Granada before today?"}
{"prompt": "I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.", "completion": "No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors."}
{"prompt": "You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?", "completion": "You will regret this."}
{"prompt": "In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!", "completion": "Savagery is what monkeys understand."}
{"prompt": "Don Moxica -- we all have to work.", "completion": "You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse."}
{"prompt": "We can't raise the wheel without it.", "completion": "My horse doesn't work."}
{"prompt": "We don't need to know.", "completion": "We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for."}
{"prompt": "If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.", "completion": "You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?"}
{"prompt": "The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.", "completion": "We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood."}
{"prompt": "We can't be.", "completion": "And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin."}
{"prompt": "What's he doing?", "completion": "He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus."}
{"prompt": "What do you read?", "completion": "Twenty eight."}
{"prompt": "Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.", "completion": "Come over here."}
{"prompt": "Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...", "completion": "And what do you think Mendez?"}
{"prompt": "Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...", "completion": "God be with us admiral."}
{"prompt": "You tell that to them!", "completion": "You're right.  Let the men decide."}
{"prompt": "You bloody...", "completion": "Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!"}
{"prompt": "Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!", "completion": "You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?"}
{"prompt": "You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!", "completion": "And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!"}
{"prompt": "We're lost!", "completion": "The land is there.  I know it!"}
{"prompt": "We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!", "completion": "You think I don't know that?"}
{"prompt": "You must be mad...!", "completion": "We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!"}
{"prompt": "You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!", "completion": "Six days ago, yes."}
{"prompt": "Where can I meet this man?", "completion": "Immediately."}
{"prompt": "Then why?", "completion": "Because he is not afraid of me."}
{"prompt": "And who would you think of, for such a task?", "completion": "I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence."}
{"prompt": "Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?", "completion": "He must be replaced."}
{"prompt": "... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...", "completion": "Is this true, Brother Buyl?"}
{"prompt": "Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.", "completion": "We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time."}
{"prompt": "... Into a monk...", "completion": "Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!"}
{"prompt": "You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.", "completion": "Never, Your Majesty.  Although..."}
{"prompt": "Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?", "completion": "Yes, Your Majesty."}
{"prompt": "...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...", "completion": "Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!"}
{"prompt": "I'm abused.  Don't you think?", "completion": "I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture."}
{"prompt": "Out on my back when I was a small boy.", "completion": "Can I see your back?"}
{"prompt": "That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.", "completion": "Your father put cigarettes out on you?"}
{"prompt": "Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?", "completion": "Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?"}
{"prompt": "Back in the Czech Republic?", "completion": "Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness..."}
{"prompt": "Your mother was blind?", "completion": "Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me."}
{"prompt": "Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.", "completion": "My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind."}
{"prompt": "I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.", "completion": "Give me another one, please."}
{"prompt": "This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.", "completion": "What else do you need?"}
{"prompt": "But it's...", "completion": "Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no."}
{"prompt": "I would say...half.  Half is fair.", "completion": "No.  No way."}
{"prompt": "Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.", "completion": "What's your cut?  How much?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.", "completion": "What about my movie rights?  Book rights?"}
{"prompt": "Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.", "completion": "No, he is here.  Shit..."}
{"prompt": "Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.", "completion": "What about Oleg?"}
{"prompt": "...delusions and paranoia.", "completion": "I was all of these."}
{"prompt": "You bring the cigarettes?", "completion": "Oh, sure."}
{"prompt": "I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.", "completion": "I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check."}
{"prompt": "I'm coming with you.", "completion": "Yes.  Yes, come with me!"}
{"prompt": "Don't say anything.", "completion": "Where are we going?"}
{"prompt": "Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?", "completion": "He has the camera!  He took the movie!"}
{"prompt": "Here.  I have your money.", "completion": "Oh no!  No!  Shit!"}
{"prompt": "Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.", "completion": "I'm not your lawyer until I see the money."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to drag you down with me.", "completion": "Daphne, I..."}
{"prompt": "Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.", "completion": "...Do you really want me to forget about you?"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "Pouring it out!"}
{"prompt": "I'll make some for us.", "completion": "I'll get my clothes."}
{"prompt": "Do you have coffee?", "completion": "In the kitchen."}
{"prompt": "You better get packed.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.", "completion": "I'm glad I met you."}
{"prompt": "If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.", "completion": "A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one."}
{"prompt": "Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?", "completion": "If I was your boyfriend, I might be."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "Is he your boyfriend?"}
{"prompt": "Are you alright?", "completion": "I still can't believe Eddie's gone."}
{"prompt": "They're not gonna send you right back.", "completion": "I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone..."}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?"}
{"prompt": "I'm just trying to find out who you are.", "completion": "I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore."}
{"prompt": "So you were never a prostitute?", "completion": "What are you asking me?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "What about back home?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I considered it.", "completion": "Did you ever turn tricks before?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  This way.", "completion": "You considered becoming a prostitute?"}
{"prompt": "The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.", "completion": "So...the station is empty?"}
{"prompt": "I can't take you to my place.", "completion": "Somewhere else?"}
{"prompt": "Divorced.", "completion": "Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?"}
{"prompt": "They won't until this is over.", "completion": "Are you married?"}
{"prompt": "If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.", "completion": "I will if they don't send me back."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but he was a cop.", "completion": "Now I become custody of police department?"}
{"prompt": "...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.", "completion": "Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide."}
{"prompt": "Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?", "completion": "You're a cop - you'll never believe me."}
{"prompt": "A cop?", "completion": "I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled."}
{"prompt": "Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.", "completion": "No, no, don't talk to Immigration!"}
{"prompt": "If I tell you, will you arrest me?", "completion": "Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?"}
{"prompt": "Go on.", "completion": "Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you."}
{"prompt": "C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?", "completion": "Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.", "completion": "I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah...?  Alright.", "completion": "I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.", "completion": "Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "It was my decision, not his."}
{"prompt": "But Chief?  Over this??", "completion": "There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial."}
{"prompt": "End my career?", "completion": "How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield."}
{"prompt": "Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.", "completion": "Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine."}
{"prompt": "What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.", "completion": "Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!"}
{"prompt": "Okay.  But not water sports.", "completion": "The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!"}
{"prompt": "Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!", "completion": "Chief - mind if I take her?"}
{"prompt": "A shower!?  Did you take one, too?", "completion": "No!  Nothing happened."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'", "completion": "I let her take a shower."}
{"prompt": "I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!", "completion": "Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up."}
{"prompt": "'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.", "completion": "Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Who do you think, Chief?!", "completion": "Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Who did cause and origin?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.", "completion": "Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?"}
{"prompt": "You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.", "completion": "Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?"}
{"prompt": "What was that, Korfin?", "completion": "I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media."}
{"prompt": "Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.", "completion": "Yeah, right."}
{"prompt": "He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!", "completion": "I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers."}
{"prompt": "Are you hit?", "completion": "No.  I'm okay."}
{"prompt": "The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.", "completion": "Stay with her."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful."}
{"prompt": "It's okay.", "completion": "Only one guys checked in?"}
{"prompt": "Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.", "completion": "Sorry...PD only."}
{"prompt": "Takin' a bath.", "completion": "Any I.D.?"}
{"prompt": "A timer.", "completion": "Where is she?"}
{"prompt": "You ready?", "completion": "What's he looking for?"}
{"prompt": "When?", "completion": "Tomorrow.  At lunch."}
{"prompt": "What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.", "completion": "I'm gonna propose."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?", "completion": "It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid."}
{"prompt": "Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.", "completion": "Vodka tonic."}
{"prompt": "He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!", "completion": "She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison."}
{"prompt": "Describe him.", "completion": "Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me."}
{"prompt": "Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.", "completion": "He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here."}
{"prompt": "Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.", "completion": "What are you saying?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Did you tell him you did?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...", "completion": "Do you have any Czech girls working for you?"}
{"prompt": "We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.", "completion": "Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?"}
{"prompt": "Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.", "completion": "What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.", "completion": "I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney..."}
{"prompt": "You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.", "completion": "Who's there?"}
{"prompt": "How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.", "completion": "Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.", "completion": "But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her."}
{"prompt": "No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.", "completion": "I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent."}
{"prompt": "Just a shower?", "completion": "Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but..."}
{"prompt": "Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.", "completion": "I took her there for a shower and that's it."}
{"prompt": "Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.", "completion": "Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her."}
{"prompt": "Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.", "completion": "Hey.  I'm a professional."}
{"prompt": "You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?", "completion": "You know what I'm saying here."}
{"prompt": "So am I.", "completion": "C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently."}
{"prompt": "My point exactly.", "completion": "I'm serious here."}
{"prompt": "What would your girlfriend think of that?", "completion": "I don't have a girlfriend."}
{"prompt": "You wanna talk to her alone?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Raw deal.", "completion": "Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her."}
{"prompt": "Something back home?", "completion": "She's fucked.  Even if that story is true."}
{"prompt": "Is that all there is?", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid", "completion": "She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her."}
{"prompt": "I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.", "completion": "Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?"}
{"prompt": "I'm on duty.", "completion": "So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back."}
{"prompt": "I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.", "completion": "You thirsty?"}
{"prompt": "Better than one.", "completion": "Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's."}
{"prompt": "I'll call it... tails.", "completion": "Two heads."}
{"prompt": "This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.", "completion": "Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come."}
{"prompt": "But what if it does?  You might need my help.", "completion": "I'll let you know what happens."}
{"prompt": "Mind if I ride along with you?", "completion": "This has nothing to do with your fire."}
{"prompt": "You goin' to the escort service?", "completion": "You got any better ideas?"}
{"prompt": "My folks are.", "completion": "Stay here."}
{"prompt": "My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.", "completion": "You're Polish?"}
{"prompt": "I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.", "completion": "This isn't homicide school."}
{"prompt": "I'll come with you.", "completion": "There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do."}
{"prompt": "Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?", "completion": "Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally."}
{"prompt": "Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?", "completion": "Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell."}
{"prompt": "Who says she's a suspect?", "completion": "What would you call her?"}
{"prompt": "Hmmmm.", "completion": "Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile."}
{"prompt": "The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.", "completion": "Pretty."}
{"prompt": "If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?", "completion": "You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal."}
{"prompt": "Did you get a report from the M.E.?", "completion": "Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?"}
{"prompt": "I don't even watch TV.", "completion": "Good.  Good.  Commendable."}
{"prompt": "Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.", "completion": "Nah, why should you?"}
{"prompt": "Nah, I musta missed it.", "completion": "Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit."}
{"prompt": "It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.", "completion": "Watch the news?"}
{"prompt": "No, what is it?", "completion": "Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?"}
{"prompt": "No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?", "completion": "You know what that is, right?"}
{"prompt": "Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?", "completion": "Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do."}
{"prompt": "If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.", "completion": "You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?"}
{"prompt": "Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.", "completion": "So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time."}
{"prompt": "I kill someone famous.", "completion": "Then do it, asshole."}
{"prompt": "Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.", "completion": "What's your accomplishment."}
{"prompt": "So...who's Nicky?", "completion": "What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Don't be late."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "See you later.  Good luck."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.", "completion": "Yeah, yeah.  Good thing."}
{"prompt": "You promise?", "completion": "Yeah.  I promise."}
{"prompt": "Okay, til tonight.", "completion": "Tonight."}
{"prompt": "Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.", "completion": "I love you."}
{"prompt": "I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.", "completion": "Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me."}
{"prompt": "I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.", "completion": "Promise?"}
{"prompt": "No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.", "completion": "No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and..."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's great.", "completion": "Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here."}
{"prompt": "That's good.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?", "completion": "Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!"}
{"prompt": "No.  Tell me what you want to say.", "completion": "Answer it."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.", "completion": "Answer the phone."}
{"prompt": "Could be Leon's.", "completion": "Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?"}
{"prompt": "You're not so bad yourself.", "completion": "Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?"}
{"prompt": "Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?", "completion": "You're ruthless."}
{"prompt": "That was good.  You were holding the evidence.", "completion": "You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not."}
{"prompt": "Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.", "completion": "Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was..."}
{"prompt": "Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.", "completion": "I'm not."}
{"prompt": "Stop it.", "completion": "Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?"}
{"prompt": "You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.", "completion": "Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh..."}
{"prompt": "What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.", "completion": "I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, honey.", "completion": "Hey."}
{"prompt": "Alright.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Alright?", "completion": "Alright."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  Now's not a good time.", "completion": "Alright."}
{"prompt": "Alright, cut, cut, cut.", "completion": "Eddie, are you okay?"}
{"prompt": "Do you have the suspect in custody?", "completion": "Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?", "completion": "He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine."}
{"prompt": "I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?", "completion": "I really can't give out any information right now at this point."}
{"prompt": "Detective - can you tell us what happened here?", "completion": "I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of."}
{"prompt": "Is it drug related?", "completion": "We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know."}
{"prompt": "Can we go up to the crime scene?", "completion": "You know you can't do that.  C'mon."}
{"prompt": "How many victims are up there?", "completion": "There are two bodies found at this point."}
{"prompt": "Detective, does it look like a murder?", "completion": "We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done."}
{"prompt": "Any chance we can do that again?", "completion": "Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  You ready?", "completion": "Yeah, yeah.  Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Ready?", "completion": "Keep them out of my way."}
{"prompt": "I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.", "completion": "You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched."}
{"prompt": "That's unique.", "completion": "Yeah.  And he still went to the party."}
{"prompt": "Not what.  Who.", "completion": "He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle."}
{"prompt": "My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?", "completion": "So what's unique?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not moody.", "completion": "How old are your kids?"}
{"prompt": "Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.", "completion": "I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ.", "completion": "Sooner or later that's everybody."}
{"prompt": "No.  Are you proposing?", "completion": "So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off."}
{"prompt": "Dog food.", "completion": "Are you married?"}
{"prompt": "You stuff sausage in it.", "completion": "And what do you do with the bones?"}
{"prompt": "I am butcher.", "completion": "You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?"}
{"prompt": "Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.", "completion": "Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?"}
{"prompt": "If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.", "completion": "Wait a minute.  Wait a minute."}
{"prompt": "We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.", "completion": "What?  It doesn't work that way."}
{"prompt": "No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.", "completion": "I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me."}
{"prompt": "Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.", "completion": "Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you."}
{"prompt": "Let her go!  Let her go!!", "completion": "If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her."}
{"prompt": "The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.", "completion": "Tell him to put his gun down!"}
{"prompt": "Get down on your knees.", "completion": "Where's your partner?"}
{"prompt": "You'll be my first.", "completion": "C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls."}
{"prompt": "Tommy, take a walk.", "completion": "You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life."}
{"prompt": "Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?", "completion": "My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend."}
{"prompt": "Give me the address!!", "completion": "Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!"}
{"prompt": "Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.", "completion": "Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time."}
{"prompt": "I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?", "completion": "Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?"}
{"prompt": "Where is escort service?", "completion": "That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?"}
{"prompt": "I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?", "completion": "It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?"}
{"prompt": "Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.", "completion": "Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser."}
{"prompt": "Hi, I'm Honey.", "completion": "Where's Czech girl?"}
{"prompt": "I'd like to speak for himself, okay?", "completion": "He doesn't speak English."}
{"prompt": "How long are you planning to stay?", "completion": "Two weeks."}
{"prompt": "No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?", "completion": "We are both from Prague."}
{"prompt": "Please join us.  Come on forward.", "completion": "Is there a problem?"}
{"prompt": "Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I have five-hundred dollars.", "completion": "Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!"}
{"prompt": "Two weeks holiday.", "completion": "How much money are you carrying with you?"}
{"prompt": "Yes sir.", "completion": "What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.  Both.", "completion": "Next.  Could I see your documents, please?"}
{"prompt": "Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?", "completion": "Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?"}
{"prompt": "Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?", "completion": "In here, says he wants a million."}
{"prompt": "New York's finest.  This is his case.", "completion": "This all you want?"}
{"prompt": "No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!", "completion": "Who is he?"}
{"prompt": "You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.", "completion": "Traitor!!"}
{"prompt": "You got that?", "completion": "No, I don't get that!"}
{"prompt": "Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.", "completion": "Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit."}
{"prompt": "I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.", "completion": "Credit?"}
{"prompt": "Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.", "completion": "Your idea?  I thought it was my idea."}
{"prompt": "Be quiet.  Watch.", "completion": "Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?"}
{"prompt": "Bad last moment - I cut it out.", "completion": "I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!"}
{"prompt": "Shut up.  Look!", "completion": "This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'"}
{"prompt": "The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.", "completion": "I'm serious."}
{"prompt": "Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!", "completion": "In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?"}
{"prompt": "Cut!", "completion": "You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?"}
{"prompt": "Good idea!", "completion": "Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!"}
{"prompt": "This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.", "completion": "No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!"}
{"prompt": "Let me get a shot of it.", "completion": "Sit down!"}
{"prompt": "What is that?", "completion": "What does it look like?  It's an address book!"}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Put the camera down, Oleg."}
{"prompt": "I did.", "completion": "And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!", "completion": "Don't want to film this?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Does it hurt?"}
{"prompt": "Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!", "completion": "Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN."}
{"prompt": "Get in the bathroom!", "completion": "Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?"}
{"prompt": "Whore?", "completion": "I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?"}
{"prompt": "How you erase this?", "completion": "I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!"}
{"prompt": "Speak English!", "completion": "You said speak Czech!"}
{"prompt": "Turn that fucking thing off!", "completion": "I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs."}
{"prompt": "Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.", "completion": "For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg."}
{"prompt": "We have no money.  Come on.", "completion": "Turn that off!  Get the bags."}
{"prompt": "Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!", "completion": "Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision."}
{"prompt": "Don't speak Russian!", "completion": "Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?"}
{"prompt": "I want to document my trip to America.", "completion": "Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Did you hear what I said?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Don't fool around."}
{"prompt": "You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?", "completion": "Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth."}
{"prompt": "A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!", "completion": "We started over, you can too."}
{"prompt": "As a plumber?!", "completion": "It's easy to learn."}
{"prompt": "A job?", "completion": "Yes, the money is good."}
{"prompt": "Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!", "completion": "I can get you a job."}
{"prompt": "We spent it!", "completion": "Ha. Ha."}
{"prompt": "Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!", "completion": "Milos.  Get my money!"}
{"prompt": "Did you hurt her?", "completion": "You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?"}
{"prompt": "Surprise!  Surprise!", "completion": "Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding."}
{"prompt": "You want the tape?  There it is!", "completion": "Emil???!"}
{"prompt": "Trust me, you'll want to take this call.", "completion": "Viewer discretion advised!"}
{"prompt": "You've got a call.", "completion": "I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey."}
{"prompt": "Robert...?", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!", "completion": "Don't give me that fucking shit."}
{"prompt": "This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.", "completion": "You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself."}
{"prompt": "Paulie, you've got kids, right?", "completion": "And you, you'll pay for what you did!"}
{"prompt": "In love?  With who?", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Isn't he a little moody?", "completion": "Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love."}
{"prompt": "That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.", "completion": "Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!"}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to tell you.", "completion": "Alright.  Go ahead."}
{"prompt": "Well, he...", "completion": "I want to hear everything he said."}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called \"It's a Wonderful Life\" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.", "completion": "Excuse me?"}
{"prompt": "I'm here for movies.", "completion": "Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?"}
{"prompt": "A cheap hotel.", "completion": "What are you coming here to do?"}
{"prompt": "New York.", "completion": "Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?"}
{"prompt": "I speak English.", "completion": "Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?"}
{"prompt": "Yes...he's my friend.", "completion": "Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he killed my partner!", "completion": "He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in."}
{"prompt": "We're takin' him.  Don't argue!", "completion": "He's my collar!"}
{"prompt": "I'll take him.", "completion": "No way!  He's mine!"}
{"prompt": "What was that?", "completion": "Evidence.  Of a homicide."}
{"prompt": "And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.", "completion": "Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight."}
{"prompt": "So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?", "completion": "That's what it looks like to me."}
{"prompt": "No.  Go ahead.", "completion": "Thanks.  Appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!", "completion": "Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here."}
{"prompt": "Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah?  Guess again.", "completion": "I'll send a cop back for you."}
{"prompt": "Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?", "completion": "Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns."}
{"prompt": "Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!", "completion": "Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.", "completion": "Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?"}
{"prompt": "I used an accelerant.", "completion": "Yeah?  What kind?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?", "completion": "How did you start the fire this time?"}
{"prompt": "They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!", "completion": "What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter."}
{"prompt": "Get outta here!", "completion": "What the hell happened?"}
{"prompt": "How was it?", "completion": "Not good."}
{"prompt": "It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!", "completion": "Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby."}
{"prompt": "If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.", "completion": "Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!"}
{"prompt": "You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.", "completion": "Aren't you tired?"}
{"prompt": "How long they been livin' here?", "completion": "You hear that question, Garcia?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe you can be his stand-in.", "completion": "-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is."}
{"prompt": "Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!"}
{"prompt": "What??", "completion": "That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us."}
{"prompt": "You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.", "completion": "He knew all along."}
{"prompt": "The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.", "completion": "But you knew that, right?"}
{"prompt": "Clean?", "completion": "Don't blow your nose!"}
{"prompt": "Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.", "completion": "Mouth's clean, too."}
{"prompt": "'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!", "completion": "Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie."}
{"prompt": "Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.", "completion": "Oh yeah, why?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?", "completion": "You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?"}
{"prompt": "Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!", "completion": "I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?"}
{"prompt": "Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.", "completion": "GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!"}
{"prompt": "Don't stoop to his level!", "completion": "Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy."}
{"prompt": "What are you gonna do?", "completion": "Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off."}
{"prompt": "Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?", "completion": "The clerk?"}
{"prompt": "That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.", "completion": "Room was registered to a Francis Capra."}
{"prompt": "We're in negotiations, that's correct.", "completion": "But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?"}
{"prompt": "Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?", "completion": "And isn't there a movie in the works about you?"}
{"prompt": "Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.", "completion": "Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?"}
{"prompt": "It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.", "completion": "You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial."}
{"prompt": "Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.", "completion": "...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?"}
{"prompt": "This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.", "completion": "Your doctor?"}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "We're trying to get there. I hope we can."}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this."}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "How did they manage to do that without any communication?"}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment."}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "She's wonderful."}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to."}
{"prompt": "SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE", "completion": "Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful."}
{"prompt": "I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.", "completion": "Roger."}
{"prompt": "I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.", "completion": "I guess not."}
{"prompt": "Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.", "completion": "I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "It's the last one."}
{"prompt": "Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.", "completion": "Hal?"}
{"prompt": "Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?", "completion": "Two more."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure."}
{"prompt": "Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.", "completion": "You're kidding."}
{"prompt": "Are you reasonably awake?", "completion": "Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?"}
{"prompt": "Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.", "completion": "Good morning. How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.", "completion": "Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's something.", "completion": "Yes, I don't know what to make of it."}
{"prompt": "I guess it isn't.", "completion": "Still, all we have to do is ask Hal."}
{"prompt": "But not completely inconceivable?", "completion": "I suppose it isn't logically impossible."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.", "completion": "I know. It would be almost inconceivable."}
{"prompt": "That's true.", "completion": "Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training."}
{"prompt": "How?", "completion": "Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I thought so.", "completion": "Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.", "completion": "That seems very unlikely."}
{"prompt": "No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.", "completion": "Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard."}
{"prompt": "Oh?", "completion": "Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out."}
{"prompt": "I suppose the idea was specialized training.", "completion": "I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation."}
{"prompt": "I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.", "completion": "No. I never did, either."}
{"prompt": "Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?", "completion": "I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out."}
{"prompt": "Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.", "completion": "It's possible."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either."}
{"prompt": "Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.", "completion": "That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18."}
{"prompt": "It's about my salary cheques.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.", "completion": "What's up?"}
{"prompt": "Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.", "completion": "Sure, what is it?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Okay, come on down."}
{"prompt": "Hi. Frank... coming in, please.", "completion": "Right. Just a sec."}
{"prompt": "I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.", "completion": "Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection."}
{"prompt": "Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.", "completion": "I am prepared to do that anyway."}
{"prompt": "Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.", "completion": "I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it."}
{"prompt": "I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.", "completion": "I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest."}
{"prompt": "Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.", "completion": "Hal, switch to manual hibernation control."}
{"prompt": "If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.", "completion": "I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please."}
{"prompt": "It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.", "completion": "I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements."}
{"prompt": "The antenna has to be replaced.", "completion": "Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation."}
{"prompt": "I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?", "completion": "I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months."}
{"prompt": "Too bad about Frank, isn't it?", "completion": "Yes, it is."}
{"prompt": "Yes, it is, Hal.", "completion": "Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission."}
{"prompt": "And don't you worry about it.", "completion": "Is your confidence in me fully restored?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.", "completion": "Well, don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.", "completion": "Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history."}
{"prompt": "Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?", "completion": "Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.", "completion": "I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I know.", "completion": "You probably also know that we found them okay."}
{"prompt": "Sure, Dave, what's up?", "completion": "You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?"}
{"prompt": "I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.", "completion": "Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something."}
{"prompt": "MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.", "completion": "The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours."}
{"prompt": "Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.", "completion": "What is it, Hal?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.", "completion": "He's got a point."}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?"}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "Still, you really don't believe it, do you?"}
{"prompt": "CONINUED", "completion": "Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?"}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "Well, what is it?"}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "Did they have any explanation for this?"}
{"prompt": "CONTINUED", "completion": "Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time."}
{"prompt": "'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.", "completion": "Goodbye, Daddy."}
{"prompt": "I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?", "completion": "Yes, Daddy."}
{"prompt": "Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.", "completion": "Thank you, Daddy."}
{"prompt": "How many days until you come home?", "completion": "Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called."}
{"prompt": "She's in the bathroom.", "completion": "Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called."}
{"prompt": "Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.", "completion": "Where is Mrs. Brown?"}
{"prompt": "In three days, darling, I hope.", "completion": "One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.", "completion": "When are you coming home?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I know that sweetheart.", "completion": "Are you coming to my party?"}
{"prompt": "I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?", "completion": "I'm having a party tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "I'll bet it's a fortune.", "completion": "I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.", "completion": "I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty."}
{"prompt": "I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.", "completion": "Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight."}
{"prompt": "Well, how's it going back there?", "completion": "Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic."}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank you very much.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.", "completion": "Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov."}
{"prompt": "No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.", "completion": "Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June."}
{"prompt": "Well, that does sound very odd.", "completion": "Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?"}
{"prompt": "Well, where are all of you off to?", "completion": "Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal."}
{"prompt": "How is gregor?", "completion": "He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days."}
{"prompt": "Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.", "completion": "Oh, that's such a delightful age."}
{"prompt": "Yes, it's coming along very well.", "completion": "And your charming little daughter?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I think so. Just about then.", "completion": "I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking."}
{"prompt": "Well, shall we go through Documentation?", "completion": "Fine."}
{"prompt": "Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?", "completion": "Yes, very pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.", "completion": "Please, it really doesn't matter."}
{"prompt": "How do you do, Mr. Miller?", "completion": "I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang."}
{"prompt": "This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.", "completion": "Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this."}
{"prompt": "Certainly.", "completion": "Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm glad about that.", "completion": "Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?"}
{"prompt": "Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.", "completion": "Fortunately, they did."}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention."}
{"prompt": "You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?", "completion": "That's right."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.", "completion": "Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.", "completion": "I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean."}
{"prompt": "Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon", "completion": "Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?"}
{"prompt": "Are you quite sure?", "completion": "Yes, really, thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?", "completion": "Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off."}
{"prompt": "Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?", "completion": "Has it been exposed to any sun before now?"}
{"prompt": "Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.", "completion": "Any ideas about the colour?"}
{"prompt": "Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill", "completion": "But you don't have any idea as to what it is?"}
{"prompt": "By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.", "completion": "Any clue as to what it is?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.", "completion": "How can you tell it was deliberately buried?"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?", "completion": "I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement."}
{"prompt": "No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.", "completion": "Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.", "completion": "Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.", "completion": "I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm."}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?"}
{"prompt": "We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?", "completion": "Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.", "completion": "When do we arrive at Clavius?"}
{"prompt": "All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.", "completion": "Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days."}
{"prompt": "Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?", "completion": "Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure."}
{"prompt": "I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.", "completion": "Let me see the tracking alignment display."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Hal, what's up?", "completion": "It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure."}
{"prompt": "Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.", "completion": "Opening pod bay doors."}
{"prompt": "Roger.", "completion": "Hal, check all airlock doors secure."}
{"prompt": "I understand.", "completion": "Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition."}
{"prompt": "Five by five, Frank.", "completion": "Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit."}
{"prompt": "Hal, have pod arms secure the component.", "completion": "Roger."}
{"prompt": "That's true.", "completion": "Thank you very much, Hal."}
{"prompt": "That's true", "completion": "There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?"}
{"prompt": "That's true.", "completion": "Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?"}
{"prompt": "Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?", "completion": "That's true."}
{"prompt": "Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?", "completion": "True."}
{"prompt": "Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.", "completion": "I will if I can, Frank."}
{"prompt": "That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.", "completion": "Great, just great."}
{"prompt": "We don't wash 'em, ya know.", "completion": "How about chargin' the battery?"}
{"prompt": "This is three years old.", "completion": "Yeah, I've been busy."}
{"prompt": "Name?", "completion": "Hammond."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "I want to pick up my car."}
{"prompt": "I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.", "completion": "Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you..."}
{"prompt": "I don't give a damn about his girl...", "completion": "Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.", "completion": "I don't give a shit who you ask."}
{"prompt": "Now how's your memory doin'?", "completion": "Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you better have a Black Russian.", "completion": "No, man, I think I'll have a vodka."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Vodka."}
{"prompt": "Hey, what about me?", "completion": "And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw."}
{"prompt": "Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.", "completion": "He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay."}
{"prompt": "They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.", "completion": "Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?"}
{"prompt": "I never paid for it in my life.", "completion": "It's better when you pay... they let you do anything."}
{"prompt": "Pay money?", "completion": "Yeah, dummy.  Money."}
{"prompt": "Whaddya mean, buy?", "completion": "Pros."}
{"prompt": "I ain't tired yet.", "completion": "Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls."}
{"prompt": "You got a real big mouth, convict.", "completion": "I want to drive awhile."}
{"prompt": "Now you're talkin'. See ya...", "completion": "Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto."}
{"prompt": "Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...", "completion": "I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?"}
{"prompt": "Here you go, baby.", "completion": "Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?"}
{"prompt": "Hello, again.", "completion": "I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party."}
{"prompt": "Well, maybe I'll see you later ...", "completion": "Here's hoping, baby..."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with my place?", "completion": "No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room..."}
{"prompt": "You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?", "completion": "No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there..."}
{"prompt": "You're in a hurry.", "completion": "Yeah, i been waiting three years."}
{"prompt": "Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?", "completion": "Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way."}
{"prompt": "No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.", "completion": "Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Hey, what kind of talk is that?", "completion": "Oh ... You're a schoolteacher..."}
{"prompt": "I'm candy...", "completion": "Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?"}
{"prompt": "Where's ganz?", "completion": "In the back.  Down the other corridor."}
{"prompt": "No chance.", "completion": "He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...", "completion": "You're gonna help us take him."}
{"prompt": "No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.", "completion": "You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls..."}
{"prompt": "I hear you've got visitors.", "completion": "Would you guys..."}
{"prompt": "How about it?", "completion": "I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money..."}
{"prompt": "I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.", "completion": "Don't give me that police shit. You drop it."}
{"prompt": "You're done.  End of story.", "completion": "I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool."}
{"prompt": "Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...", "completion": "I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot."}
{"prompt": "After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...", "completion": "I don't think you're gonna make it."}
{"prompt": "You lying son of a bitch...", "completion": "What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ..."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?"}
{"prompt": "No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.", "completion": "Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in."}
{"prompt": "That's right. Not my style, Reggie..", "completion": "You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here."}
{"prompt": "It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.", "completion": "And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.", "completion": "There's nothin' to talk about."}
{"prompt": "Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.", "completion": "Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.", "completion": "You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own..."}
{"prompt": "Well, you got to admit we come a long way.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.", "completion": "Partnership?"}
{"prompt": "If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.", "completion": "Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, there she is...", "completion": "Whatever play I maker just back me up."}
{"prompt": "What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.", "completion": "I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it."}
{"prompt": "Do I get to kiss her too?", "completion": "If she's right, and if you don't screw up."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...", "completion": "Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV..."}
{"prompt": "It's late, they're closing...", "completion": "Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.", "completion": "Yeah, but we didn't get 'em."}
{"prompt": "I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.", "completion": "Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down."}
{"prompt": "I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.", "completion": "Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. It missed the last four stops.", "completion": "Hey, how'd my car get here?"}
{"prompt": "Luther's on the move...", "completion": "Notice something funny about that bus?"}
{"prompt": "When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.", "completion": "That was quick."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Guess not.", "completion": "Yeah, I see her."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.", "completion": "Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ..."}
{"prompt": "I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...", "completion": "You sure that's the reason?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?", "completion": "Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you..."}
{"prompt": "They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the \"Don't Disturb\" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.", "completion": "So you took the rest of the night off..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.", "completion": "Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it."}
{"prompt": "We missed.", "completion": "You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call."}
{"prompt": "What about Luther?", "completion": "What about Ganz?"}
{"prompt": "Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.", "completion": "Hello. And goodbye."}
{"prompt": "I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?", "completion": "Where's luther?"}
{"prompt": "No way...", "completion": "Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.", "completion": "You stay with me..."}
{"prompt": "That was in style a couple years back, man.", "completion": "Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set."}
{"prompt": "We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?", "completion": "Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?"}
{"prompt": "No class...", "completion": "Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife."}
{"prompt": "You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.", "completion": "What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks."}
{"prompt": "A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...", "completion": "Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...", "completion": "If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb."}
{"prompt": "I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...", "completion": "You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile..."}
{"prompt": "If they don't tell me what I need to know...", "completion": "Doesn't it get... Tiring?"}
{"prompt": "That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.", "completion": "Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?"}
{"prompt": "I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...", "completion": "I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it."}
{"prompt": "I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.", "completion": "Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?"}
{"prompt": "Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.", "completion": "If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town."}
{"prompt": "I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.", "completion": "You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?", "completion": "Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs."}
{"prompt": "Musta got some primo bondsman.", "completion": "Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door."}
{"prompt": "Guess what?  Luther just got in line.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.", "completion": "Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit."}
{"prompt": "I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.", "completion": "Shit."}
{"prompt": "You just drove by it.", "completion": "You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing."}
{"prompt": "This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.", "completion": "...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone."}
{"prompt": "Where's the goddamn car?", "completion": "You're a real case, you know that, Jack?"}
{"prompt": "Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.", "completion": "Yeah.  Right."}
{"prompt": "In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?", "completion": "Right, partner."}
{"prompt": "Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.", "completion": "Where's the money?"}
{"prompt": "Not likely, convict.", "completion": "You gonna let me keep any of it?"}
{"prompt": "You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?", "completion": "We split 50-50?"}
{"prompt": "Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.", "completion": "He's after your money."}
{"prompt": "Jesus.", "completion": "Just tell me about the money."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "Half a million."}
{"prompt": "One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.", "completion": "I been waiting a long time for some money."}
{"prompt": "Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.", "completion": "They saved your ass, convict."}
{"prompt": "Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...", "completion": "Yeah, right.  You want to try again?"}
{"prompt": "Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...", "completion": "Maybe I don't like the way you ask."}
{"prompt": "You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...", "completion": "I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night."}
{"prompt": "This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.", "completion": "You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.", "completion": "Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and..."}
{"prompt": "Must be billy's girl.", "completion": "Come on."}
{"prompt": "While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.", "completion": "There."}
{"prompt": "Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.", "completion": "You made that move, huh?"}
{"prompt": "My kind of place. I always liked country boys.", "completion": "That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control."}
{"prompt": "I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.", "completion": "This place don't seem real popular with the brothers."}
{"prompt": "The bet's off.", "completion": "I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge."}
{"prompt": "You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.", "completion": "I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed."}
{"prompt": "I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.", "completion": "What are you talkin' about?"}
{"prompt": "Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.", "completion": "That's never been one of my problems."}
{"prompt": "I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.", "completion": "If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid..."}
{"prompt": "You need five years training to handle a joint like...", "completion": "Hey, you wanna bet?"}
{"prompt": "Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...", "completion": "I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge..."}
{"prompt": "If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...", "completion": "But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats..."}
{"prompt": "This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...", "completion": "Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?"}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.", "completion": "At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?"}
{"prompt": "Last night.", "completion": "You have a good time?"}
{"prompt": "I don't give out the details.", "completion": "Last night, two nights ago, three?"}
{"prompt": "Now, where we goin', convict?", "completion": "Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian."}
{"prompt": "You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?", "completion": "She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?"}
{"prompt": "Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?", "completion": "Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.", "completion": "Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor."}
{"prompt": "We eat when I say we eat.", "completion": "Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn \"trim\" hunt... stop moaning.", "completion": "Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl."}
{"prompt": "We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.", "completion": "Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up."}
{"prompt": "He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.", "completion": "If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think you better put him on ice, man."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Want to try it again?"}
{"prompt": "Just throw me the Goddamn gun.", "completion": "Hey, this works pretty good."}
{"prompt": "I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.", "completion": "I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me."}
{"prompt": "I'm helpin' you, huh?", "completion": "Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man."}
{"prompt": "Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?", "completion": "Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me."}
{"prompt": "I may call you worse than that.", "completion": "Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company."}
{"prompt": "I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.", "completion": "Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead...."}
{"prompt": "I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.", "completion": "Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'."}
{"prompt": "Luther was part of the gang?", "completion": "What gang you talkin' about, Jack?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?", "completion": "Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers."}
{"prompt": "Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.", "completion": "Shit.  I'm already sorry."}
{"prompt": "You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.", "completion": "No way to start a partnership."}
{"prompt": "You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.", "completion": "Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal."}
{"prompt": "Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...", "completion": "I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of..."}
{"prompt": "What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.", "completion": "We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers..."}
{"prompt": "I'll think about it.", "completion": "This prison gives out $400 suits?"}
{"prompt": "Bullshit.", "completion": "It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz."}
{"prompt": "What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?", "completion": "I got a lot to protect."}
{"prompt": "You're crazy.", "completion": "I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first."}
{"prompt": "Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.", "completion": "Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie."}
{"prompt": "Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.", "completion": "Yeah, I noticed..."}
{"prompt": "Sure, anything you want.", "completion": "You here to write my life story?"}
{"prompt": "You got a name, cop?", "completion": "Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Where the Christ do you think you're going?", "completion": "I'm taking my prisoner back to jail."}
{"prompt": "He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.", "completion": "Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?."}
{"prompt": "I didn't have the time.", "completion": "Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike."}
{"prompt": "Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.", "completion": "Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?"}
{"prompt": "You couldn't get to him?", "completion": "What a screw-up."}
{"prompt": "Which one pulled the trigger?", "completion": "The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away."}
{"prompt": "How did they get away?", "completion": "They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train."}
{"prompt": "What the bell happened?", "completion": "I lost them, that's what happened."}
{"prompt": "Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.", "completion": "I'll keep it in mind."}
{"prompt": "Jack?", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.", "completion": "You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go."}
{"prompt": "You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.", "completion": "Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead..."}
{"prompt": "Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?", "completion": "Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it."}
{"prompt": "Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.", "completion": "Yeah..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I read the report...", "completion": "Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back."}
{"prompt": "I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...", "completion": "I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun."}
{"prompt": "Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.", "completion": "Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap."}
{"prompt": "But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...", "completion": "The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?"}
{"prompt": "That's what you say, Cates...", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?", "completion": "I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty."}
{"prompt": "I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I got to wait for a call.", "completion": "Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest..."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit red tape.", "completion": "I'm heading out. How about you?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.", "completion": "Doesn't look like it."}
{"prompt": "So do you...been a long day.", "completion": "Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you."}
{"prompt": "One of  em's in the slam.", "completion": "You look awful."}
{"prompt": "I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?", "completion": "Here's the file. Cates checks the file."}
{"prompt": "Tell me that's not the same guy.", "completion": "Hey ... Dick Tracy."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?", "completion": "Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job."}
{"prompt": "Who are all these?", "completion": "They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago."}
{"prompt": "Billy Bear...", "completion": "Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang."}
{"prompt": "This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.", "completion": "Shit."}
{"prompt": "Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.", "completion": "I'll help you out."}
{"prompt": "I dunno ... he's gonna call me...", "completion": "Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?"}
{"prompt": "He ... he wants me to help him skip town.", "completion": "When? How?"}
{"prompt": "I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Who gives a fuck what you think?", "completion": "Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie."}
{"prompt": "Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.", "completion": "You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is."}
{"prompt": "A cop...", "completion": "I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?"}
{"prompt": "You're impossible...", "completion": "That's what I always say."}
{"prompt": "Tell me.", "completion": "He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off."}
{"prompt": "Where is he?", "completion": "Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.", "completion": "Three more hours..."}
{"prompt": "Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.", "completion": "I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that."}
{"prompt": "Let's go, Reggie.", "completion": "How'd they take it back at headquarters?"}
{"prompt": "Whaddya think?", "completion": "What do I know?  I'm just a bartender."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.", "completion": "Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out."}
{"prompt": "So what?", "completion": "When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible."}
{"prompt": "Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.", "completion": "It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him."}
{"prompt": "Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...", "completion": "What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?"}
{"prompt": "Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...", "completion": "How do you know?"}
{"prompt": "I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.", "completion": "Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit..."}
{"prompt": "We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...", "completion": "You real down?"}
{"prompt": "Don't.  We've had a hard night.", "completion": "I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Hiya, kid.", "completion": "I ought to have you and your friend thrown out..."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you.", "completion": "Hey, I don't believe it."}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "Hi, it's me..."}
{"prompt": "Jack, wait...", "completion": "Just a second, that's all!"}
{"prompt": "Jack?  What was that?", "completion": "Elaine, I gotta put you on hold..."}
{"prompt": "So am I.", "completion": "The number ... what's the Goddamn number?"}
{"prompt": "No wonder you're so popular.", "completion": "No, it's I'm just surprised you called."}
{"prompt": "I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?", "completion": "Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business."}
{"prompt": "Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?", "completion": "This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave."}
{"prompt": "Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....", "completion": "Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there."}
{"prompt": "That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...", "completion": "I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it."}
{"prompt": "I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.", "completion": "Here it comes again ... the sacred job..."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...", "completion": "Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function..."}
{"prompt": "Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...", "completion": "Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...", "completion": "Jack, are you okay?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, one of my favorites.", "completion": "You made the front page."}
{"prompt": "Guess people ought to know who I am...", "completion": "Great place for lunch."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the coffee.", "completion": "I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge..."}
{"prompt": "You sure you want me to?", "completion": "Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure..."}
{"prompt": "That's the way I see it, too.", "completion": "Call me later."}
{"prompt": "I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.", "completion": "You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless."}
{"prompt": "When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.", "completion": "What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe that makes a nice excuse.", "completion": "Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about."}
{"prompt": "That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.", "completion": "Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you ought to buy me one.", "completion": "Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back."}
{"prompt": "You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.", "completion": "What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.", "completion": "I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em."}
{"prompt": "If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.", "completion": "Hey, you know what I really think?"}
{"prompt": "Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?", "completion": "I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it."}
{"prompt": "Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...", "completion": "Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you."}
{"prompt": "Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.", "completion": "I guess he got the message..."}
{"prompt": "A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.", "completion": "What'd you do?"}
{"prompt": "I'm all wet.", "completion": "What's wrong with that?"}
{"prompt": "You're hopeless.", "completion": "That's the way I see it, too."}
{"prompt": "I still don't think it's loaded.", "completion": "Hey, you're right."}
{"prompt": "I don't think your gun's loaded...", "completion": "This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?"}
{"prompt": "What am I wanted for?", "completion": "I don't answer questions, I ask 'em..."}
{"prompt": "He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...", "completion": "In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, two days with him is enough.", "completion": "That's no bull."}
{"prompt": "Hard man to live with.", "completion": "How would you know?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...", "completion": "Shrink major, not a shrink."}
{"prompt": "Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.", "completion": "I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop."}
{"prompt": "Alright, I'm coming...hold on.", "completion": "Who the hell are you?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "Keep stallin'."}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Stall."}
{"prompt": "What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.", "completion": "What do you want?  What's goin' on?"}
{"prompt": "Hey...", "completion": "Shut up."}
{"prompt": "We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?", "completion": "Sure, right."}
{"prompt": "We got a lot to talk about.", "completion": "Yeah, old times."}

{"prompt": "Rosalie, you okay?", "completion": "What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her."}
{"prompt": "Let her go.", "completion": "First, the money."}
{"prompt": "Come on, you can trust me. Please.", "completion": "You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe."}
{"prompt": "You chickenshit punk...", "completion": "Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away..."}
{"prompt": "When?", "completion": "I can't get it until Monday. Honest."}
{"prompt": "Billy, go ahead, break it...", "completion": "No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money."}
{"prompt": "Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...", "completion": "Don't give me this, we were partners."}
{"prompt": "I don't know what you're talkin' about.", "completion": "You want that Indian to snap her neck?"}
{"prompt": "Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-", "completion": "I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid..."}
{"prompt": "I'll got your money to you. No sweat.", "completion": "Surprise, Luther."}
{"prompt": "Try and take it.", "completion": "Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?", "completion": "Give it back."}
{"prompt": "Five.  On credit.", "completion": "This ain't a credit business."}
{"prompt": "Don't mess with me. How much?", "completion": "Five bills."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used..."}
{"prompt": "How about some ammo?", "completion": "It's loaded... I got some shells in here."}
{"prompt": "You sure?", "completion": "I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass."}

{"prompt": "Just do it, Amy, please, go.", "completion": "What happened to you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there", "completion": "... What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...", "completion": "What's wrong?  Are you alright?"}

{"prompt": "Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.", "completion": "I understand."}
{"prompt": "I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?", "completion": "Betty's out of town so we're playing next week."}
{"prompt": "Sure.  I'll call the guy.", "completion": "You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?"}
{"prompt": "I love you.", "completion": "You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?"}

{"prompt": "Well, I'm not smoking, okay?", "completion": "Okay, I believe you."}

{"prompt": "There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?", "completion": "Welcome home."}
{"prompt": "What you see is what I got, mister.", "completion": "You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing harder.", "completion": "Snuff?"}

{"prompt": "There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.", "completion": "Dino..."}
{"prompt": "Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?", "completion": "Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!"}
{"prompt": "Bullshit.", "completion": "I'm telling you..."}

{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop."}
{"prompt": "I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...", "completion": "How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company."}
{"prompt": "He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...", "completion": "Bring the film, or we kill him."}
{"prompt": "Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...", "completion": "Can you guess what I'm going to say next?"}

{"prompt": "What are you... ?", "completion": "Take out your gun!"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?"}
{"prompt": "What are these for?", "completion": "Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?"}
{"prompt": "Where are the women?", "completion": "They should be here any minute."}
{"prompt": "Right here.", "completion": "Excellent."}
{"prompt": "Brooklyn.  Don't be late.", "completion": "You brought the money?"}
{"prompt": "He's in.  It will be his pleasure.", "completion": "Where's that?"}
{"prompt": "I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.", "completion": "Machine's in?"}
{"prompt": "You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?", "completion": "Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business."}
{"prompt": "What's the problem?", "completion": "I'm camera shy."}
{"prompt": "You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?", "completion": "I'd rather you didn't."}
{"prompt": "We can do that.", "completion": "Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good."}
{"prompt": "If it's not him, there's no deal.", "completion": "He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand."}
{"prompt": "And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.", "completion": "Machine."}
{"prompt": "I want to watch you work.", "completion": "I'll consider it."}
{"prompt": "Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.", "completion": "And they are?"}
{"prompt": "That's five thousand dollars.", "completion": "Is it?"}
{"prompt": "You said something about money.", "completion": "Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific."}
{"prompt": "A fellow investor.", "completion": "Hmm."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.", "completion": "Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?"}

{"prompt": "You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?", "completion": "You betrayed us."}
{"prompt": "... sorry...", "completion": "First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles..."}
{"prompt": "Leave him alone.", "completion": "Fuck off."}
{"prompt": "Move it, dirtbag... !", "completion": "You're a dead man."}
{"prompt": "Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.", "completion": "Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max."}
{"prompt": "It's good what you're doing.", "completion": "Is that him?"}
{"prompt": "It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.", "completion": "You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?"}
{"prompt": "Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.", "completion": "Any good?"}
{"prompt": "They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.", "completion": "Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry."}
{"prompt": "They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.", "completion": "I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me..."}
{"prompt": "This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.", "completion": "I'm not so sure about this."}
{"prompt": "For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.", "completion": "Why don't they come to me?"}
{"prompt": "I figured you share information.", "completion": "We do."}
{"prompt": "Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.", "completion": "Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?"}
{"prompt": "There are reasons for the way we do things here.", "completion": "Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out..."}
{"prompt": "Alright, Tom.", "completion": "What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens..."}
{"prompt": "What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?", "completion": "Call me Tom."}
{"prompt": "That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you \"felt like it.\"  Almost makes you worse.", "completion": "What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?"}
{"prompt": "Easy enough for you.", "completion": "I never killed anyone."}
{"prompt": "Don't think I won't.", "completion": "Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?"}
{"prompt": "I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.", "completion": "Do it."}
{"prompt": "I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.", "completion": "Where?  Show me where."}
{"prompt": "You got absolute zero.", "completion": "Show me where you buried her."}
{"prompt": "You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...", "completion": "Stop talking."}
{"prompt": "Keep moving.", "completion": "Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?"}
{"prompt": "Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.", "completion": "Show me."}
{"prompt": "There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.", "completion": "What did you do with her body?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...", "completion": "Nobody saw you bring her in?"}
{"prompt": "Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.", "completion": "Tell me what happened."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.", "completion": "You enjoy it?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because we're going there."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!", "completion": "Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck do you want from me?", "completion": "I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!"}
{"prompt": "Something like that.", "completion": "What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?"}
{"prompt": "It was a lot of fucking money.", "completion": "So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out."}
{"prompt": "Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.", "completion": "That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "How much did he pay you?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, the fucking lawyer.", "completion": "Told him you could get him a snuff film."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.", "completion": "Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up."}
{"prompt": "I told you, I don't know.", "completion": "I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude."}
{"prompt": "I don't know...", "completion": "I want his name."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "Who is Machine?"}
{"prompt": "Fuck you!", "completion": "Starting to recognize a pattern?"}
{"prompt": "How'd you find me here?", "completion": "Don't ask questions."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna kill you.", "completion": "Don't bore me with that bullshit."}
{"prompt": "What's he talking about?", "completion": "One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had..."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck are you.. ?", "completion": "You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good."}
{"prompt": "Who is this.", "completion": "You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I know what you did."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, who's this?", "completion": "I know what you did."}
{"prompt": "Celebrity Films.", "completion": "Eddie."}
{"prompt": "Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.", "completion": "Fuck you!"}
{"prompt": "The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?", "completion": "Look, you cocksucker..."}
{"prompt": "I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?", "completion": "Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?"}
{"prompt": "Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?", "completion": "You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up."}
{"prompt": "Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.", "completion": "He's lying."}
{"prompt": "You'll get it when we get there.", "completion": "Give me the film."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you.", "completion": "Give me the film."}
{"prompt": "Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?", "completion": "You almost went over your limit."}
{"prompt": "Isn't it incredibly obvious?", "completion": "Enlighten me."}
{"prompt": "A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...", "completion": "Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?"}
{"prompt": "You're asking me why?", "completion": "I'm asking."}
{"prompt": "You're making me very angry.", "completion": "Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?"}
{"prompt": "Shut your mouth and drive!", "completion": "Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered."}
{"prompt": "Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.", "completion": "You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one..."}
{"prompt": "Except, you're willing commit murder with them.", "completion": "None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers."}
{"prompt": "Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...", "completion": "They're no friends of mine."}
{"prompt": "That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?", "completion": "Never mind how I found you."}
{"prompt": "Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.", "completion": "I was well compensated."}
{"prompt": "So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.", "completion": "That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly."}
{"prompt": "You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.", "completion": "Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval."}
{"prompt": "Of what sort?", "completion": "You are a private investigator?"}
{"prompt": "I'm listening.", "completion": "As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend."}
{"prompt": "It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.", "completion": "Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you."}
{"prompt": "It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.", "completion": "Look... that's awful generous and everything..."}
{"prompt": "Nope.", "completion": "What's this?"}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.", "completion": "Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?"}
{"prompt": "\"Devil\" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.", "completion": "What's next?"}
{"prompt": "What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?", "completion": "I know if I had to pick, it'd be \"Choke,\" or \"Devil.\""}
{"prompt": "Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself \"Machine,\" that's what they call him.  Machine.", "completion": "You don't need to be here."}
{"prompt": "I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...", "completion": "Who is he, his name?"}
{"prompt": "Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?", "completion": "Who is he?"}
{"prompt": "It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?", "completion": "Wha... ?"}
{"prompt": "Great.", "completion": "Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?"}
{"prompt": "You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.", "completion": "It's their Presidential Suite."}
{"prompt": "Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.", "completion": "See ya."}
{"prompt": "Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.", "completion": "You want me to come out there and play private eye?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?", "completion": "I'm a working stiff, pops."}
{"prompt": "Alright, I get the picture.", "completion": "He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art."}
{"prompt": "Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...", "completion": "Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a..."}
{"prompt": "You're learning.", "completion": "Where does he sell it?"}
{"prompt": "His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.", "completion": "Specialty product."}
{"prompt": "Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.", "completion": "A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?"}
{"prompt": "So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?", "completion": "Good question."}
{"prompt": "I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?", "completion": "A daughter."}
{"prompt": "You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?", "completion": "What about me?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.", "completion": "You're telling me it doesn't get to you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?", "completion": "You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, where are yours?", "completion": "I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?"}
{"prompt": "Twenty-five.", "completion": "Where are your parents?"}
{"prompt": "First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.", "completion": "How old are you?"}
{"prompt": "I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.", "completion": "What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?"}
{"prompt": "There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.", "completion": "Snuff films."}
{"prompt": "What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.", "completion": "Child pornography."}
{"prompt": "You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.", "completion": "Interesting theory."}

{"prompt": "Four hundred a week, off the books.", "completion": "Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "How much do you make now?"}
{"prompt": "From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?", "completion": "Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money."}
{"prompt": "You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.", "completion": "Not quite."}
{"prompt": "You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.", "completion": "I'm not a cop."}
{"prompt": "There's not much illegal.", "completion": "Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now."}
{"prompt": "Max.", "completion": "Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally..."}
{"prompt": "Three, four years.", "completion": "What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?"}
{"prompt": "Good for you.", "completion": "How long you been working there?"}
{"prompt": "Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.", "completion": "I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight."}
{"prompt": "Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.", "completion": "I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help."}
{"prompt": "Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?", "completion": "Remember me?"}
{"prompt": "I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.", "completion": "Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts."}
{"prompt": "Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.", "completion": "Truman Capote."}
{"prompt": "I'll risk it.", "completion": "Once you pick it up you can't put it down."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.", "completion": "It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one."}
{"prompt": "Pardon me?", "completion": "My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling."}
{"prompt": "Yeah... guess so.", "completion": "Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?"}
{"prompt": "If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.", "completion": "Big date tonight?"}
{"prompt": "I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.", "completion": "How will I get it to you?"}
{"prompt": "I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.", "completion": "Fine..."}
{"prompt": "I hope it's nothing serious.", "completion": "Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?", "completion": "I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.", "completion": "How are you?  Having any luck?"}
{"prompt": "You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.", "completion": "Hello?"}
{"prompt": "Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?", "completion": "You told me to look, so I looked."}
{"prompt": "For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "I'm here.", "completion": "Do you think the film could have cost that much?"}
{"prompt": "To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.", "completion": "Hello... ?"}
{"prompt": "Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.", "completion": "You're joking."}
{"prompt": "One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...", "completion": "Okay, I follow you so far..."}
{"prompt": "I'm not positive this means anything.", "completion": "The checks were for odd amounts..."}
{"prompt": "Okay...", "completion": "My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash."}
{"prompt": "Nothing remotely like this.", "completion": "I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her."}
{"prompt": "I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...", "completion": "You've found missing persons before."}
{"prompt": "It won't work like that.", "completion": "Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her."}
{"prompt": "You don't have any other choice.", "completion": "No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first..."}
{"prompt": "You... you need to go to the police.", "completion": "I told you I can't, not yet."}
{"prompt": "Will you watch it and see for yourself?", "completion": "Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about."}
{"prompt": "I'm telling you it's not that.", "completion": "I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play..."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.", "completion": "Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects..."}
{"prompt": "This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.", "completion": "I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police..."}
{"prompt": "It's a film... of a girl being murdered.", "completion": "I'm afraid I don't..."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to tell me what you found?", "completion": "Cash, stock certificates, and this..."}
{"prompt": "You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.", "completion": "There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize..."}
{"prompt": "Just curious.", "completion": "My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is."}
{"prompt": "Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?", "completion": "I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason."}
{"prompt": "He succeeded.", "completion": "We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply."}
{"prompt": "Pittsburgh?", "completion": "Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary."}
{"prompt": "His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.", "completion": "I'll do whatever I can to help."}
{"prompt": "As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.", "completion": "My condolences."}
{"prompt": "I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.", "completion": "You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality."}
{"prompt": "He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...", "completion": "I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "He's odd."}
{"prompt": "Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.", "completion": "Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?"}
{"prompt": "I try to be.", "completion": "Uh huh, pleasure."}
{"prompt": "They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...", "completion": "Mister Welles. You're very prompt."}
{"prompt": "They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...", "completion": "Why... why are you doing this to me... ?"}
{"prompt": "He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...", "completion": "No... no... no..."}
{"prompt": "They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...", "completion": "No..."}
{"prompt": "Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.", "completion": "Who is this... ?"}
{"prompt": "She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...", "completion": "What... ?"}
{"prompt": "I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...", "completion": "What are you talking about... ?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...", "completion": "I remember.  You just left..."}
{"prompt": "What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.", "completion": "Hello... ?"}
{"prompt": "I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.", "completion": "It's been six years."}
{"prompt": "You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...", "completion": "You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?"}
{"prompt": "How... how can you say that to me...?", "completion": "Will you let me look?"}
{"prompt": "No.  You don't have any reason to think that...", "completion": "If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  I think so.", "completion": "It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something..."}
{"prompt": "There wasn't one.  The police looked.", "completion": "Do you think the police did a good job?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye."}
{"prompt": "You should be.", "completion": "I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though."}
{"prompt": "Are you religious?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.", "completion": "We're all like that."}
{"prompt": "I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "I had to ask.  I apologize.", "completion": "No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts."}
{"prompt": "I didn't mean to...", "completion": "You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either."}
{"prompt": "You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?", "completion": "There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left..."}
{"prompt": "Why do you think he did it?", "completion": "It got to be too much for him."}
{"prompt": "September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.", "completion": "We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend..."}
{"prompt": "If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What was she running from?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "She just seemed... depressed... ?", "completion": "She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes."}
{"prompt": "So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.", "completion": "You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her."}
{"prompt": "They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?", "completion": "That's exactly what I am."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?", "completion": "It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope."}
{"prompt": "Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...", "completion": "Neil... Neil Cole."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but...", "completion": "These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh..."}
{"prompt": "I don't understand, who are... ?", "completion": "I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?"}
{"prompt": "Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...", "completion": "I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter."}
{"prompt": "I'll do what I can.", "completion": "Yes... ?"}
{"prompt": "Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?", "completion": "She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?"}
{"prompt": "Her belongings?", "completion": "That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture."}
{"prompt": "What is this?", "completion": "Those are her belongings."}
{"prompt": "Do you know what happened to her?", "completion": "I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents."}
{"prompt": "You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...", "completion": "Yes.  I remember her."}
{"prompt": "Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.", "completion": "Yes... I remember Mary"}
{"prompt": "The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...", "completion": "Yes, Mister Welles, thank you."}
{"prompt": "No, sir, he is not.", "completion": "He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?"}
{"prompt": "Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...", "completion": "None too discreet, is he?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.", "completion": "Certainly, sir."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Fine.", "completion": "I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of..."}
{"prompt": "Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?", "completion": "No, you may not."}
{"prompt": "Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.", "completion": "Cash."}
{"prompt": "Then we'll stay up together.", "completion": "Okay, I'll take it all."}
{"prompt": "We'll figure it out.", "completion": "Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me."}
{"prompt": "I can't go back to sleep again.", "completion": "I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen..."}
{"prompt": "It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.", "completion": "Yeah, or turn you into toast."}
{"prompt": "I can't find him.", "completion": "Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's."}
{"prompt": "It was bad.", "completion": "Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?"}
{"prompt": "Kristen...", "completion": "I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You alright?"}
{"prompt": "What's wrong?", "completion": "Kincaid and Joey died last night."}
{"prompt": "Never say can't.  Just do what I do.", "completion": "Alice, you think you can leave?"}
{"prompt": "Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.", "completion": "Rick...I can't."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.", "completion": "But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that."}
{"prompt": "The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.", "completion": "I don't want to."}
{"prompt": "Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Kristen, what happened?", "completion": "You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't."}
{"prompt": "You what?", "completion": "When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying."}
{"prompt": "How'd you learn so much about dreams?", "completion": "When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert."}
{"prompt": "Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?", "completion": "I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control."}
{"prompt": "Sounds like a game show host to me.", "completion": "No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up."}
{"prompt": "You could do worse.", "completion": "My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm not so sure.", "completion": "I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad."}
{"prompt": "Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.", "completion": "I'm sure they're around."}
{"prompt": "Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...", "completion": "Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you."}
{"prompt": "That obvious, huh?", "completion": "Then you saw him, too?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You've been up all night?"}
{"prompt": "Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.", "completion": "We have matching luggage."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.", "completion": "I know.  I hardly have any time to study."}
{"prompt": "Save it for later.  Come on!", "completion": "You in a hurry?"}
{"prompt": "Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.", "completion": "You look great!"}
{"prompt": "Something's wrong here.  It feels like...", "completion": "What the hell was that?"}
{"prompt": "You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.", "completion": "Here we are."}
{"prompt": "It's okay, we're just about there.", "completion": "He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him."}
{"prompt": "Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.", "completion": "As long as your driving doesn't kill us."}
{"prompt": "Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.", "completion": "You just feel sorry for me."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him."}
{"prompt": "Then what else can we do?", "completion": "Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us."}
{"prompt": "Why can't we just talk to the authorities?", "completion": "Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't."}
{"prompt": "I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.", "completion": "You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him."}
{"prompt": "Not really.", "completion": "Is there something we can do?"}
{"prompt": "Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?", "completion": "Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him."}
{"prompt": "How long have you been awake?", "completion": "Three days."}
{"prompt": "No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.", "completion": "The story is, the deaths you can't argue with."}
{"prompt": "Extra money, huh?", "completion": "Look, you know why, you just don't believe me."}
{"prompt": "Kristen's story really got to her.", "completion": "I've been working double shifts."}
{"prompt": "\"In her dream\"?", "completion": "No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!"}
{"prompt": "It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.", "completion": "I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful..."}
{"prompt": "I know.  Uh...Alice.", "completion": "I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed."}
{"prompt": "Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.", "completion": "Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan."}
{"prompt": "No...", "completion": "You're his sister, right?"}
{"prompt": "Enough of that crap.", "completion": "I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in..."}
{"prompt": "Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.", "completion": "It was Freddy."}
{"prompt": "I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.", "completion": "Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep."}
{"prompt": "Rick, please.", "completion": "Alright, I think I see salvation..."}
{"prompt": "About Freddy?", "completion": "What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back."}
{"prompt": "How she doing?  I ran into her last night.", "completion": "She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened."}
{"prompt": "She knew she was gonna die.", "completion": "Been up with Alice."}
{"prompt": "Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.", "completion": "Hey man, we're all sorry..."}
{"prompt": "It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.", "completion": "Nice neighborhood."}
{"prompt": "She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.", "completion": "So?"}
{"prompt": "Let me talk to you.", "completion": "So what's up?  What'd I miss?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.", "completion": "I don't get it."}
{"prompt": "Earth to Alice...", "completion": "Hey, Rick!"}
{"prompt": "Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...", "completion": "T-T-Thanks Alice..."}
{"prompt": "Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!", "completion": "Honey, we went over this in therapy."}
{"prompt": "Your distraught.  It'll help...", "completion": "I'm sorry honey, but..."}
{"prompt": "You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.", "completion": "What's wrong with me?"}
{"prompt": "Something the matter with the cuisine?", "completion": "Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite."}
{"prompt": "It's okay, babe.  We're with you.", "completion": "I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed."}
{"prompt": "I'll tell you later.", "completion": "It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream."}
{"prompt": "I though Freddy was just an old town story.", "completion": "It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back."}
{"prompt": "Oh God!  He killed them!", "completion": "Now you know who and what Freddy really is."}
{"prompt": "When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.", "completion": "What is it?"}

{"prompt": "Don't worry, honey", "completion": "Something wrong with the stairs?"}
{"prompt": "You just stay put.  You need rest.", "completion": "You don't get it, he's after me..."}
{"prompt": "You had a nasty bump.", "completion": "I gotta get out of here."}
{"prompt": "Feeling better now?", "completion": "Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?"}
{"prompt": "We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.", "completion": "You're not taking my baby!"}
{"prompt": "In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --", "completion": "What are you talking about?  My \"condition\"?..."}
{"prompt": "Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.", "completion": "And ours.  It's our grandchild."}
{"prompt": "Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?", "completion": "What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him."}
{"prompt": "Excuse us, dear.", "completion": "It's okay, Dan"}
{"prompt": "But how...?", "completion": "He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me."}
{"prompt": "Where is he?", "completion": "He's inside you, where he hides."}
{"prompt": "Mommy...?", "completion": "Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both."}
{"prompt": "Who says I don't like you?", "completion": "My friend, with the funny hand."}
{"prompt": "No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?", "completion": "Who said I...wait, what?"}
{"prompt": "She doesn't want me around", "completion": "Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be."}
{"prompt": "No...", "completion": "I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom."}
{"prompt": "Been having bad dreams.", "completion": "Is that who you're waiting for?"}
{"prompt": "I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.", "completion": "Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.", "completion": "How did you know that?"}
{"prompt": "It's lonely in there, in my room.", "completion": "My name is..."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?"}
{"prompt": "Me too.", "completion": "Hey...wake up."}
{"prompt": "You're right.", "completion": "There you go.  Love you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah...I guess.", "completion": "You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember..."}
{"prompt": "No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.", "completion": "You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream."}
{"prompt": "He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?", "completion": "About him?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, babe.  What's the matter?", "completion": "Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony."}
{"prompt": "They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, babe.", "completion": "The tickets."}
{"prompt": "Hi, beautiful.", "completion": "Jesus!  Don't do that!"}
{"prompt": "But Dad --", "completion": "Now."}
{"prompt": "I've got to go.", "completion": "No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.", "completion": "Alice!"}
{"prompt": "Since my little girl became a mom...", "completion": "You disappointed in me?"}
{"prompt": "Alice...", "completion": "Since when are you such a smart shopper?"}
{"prompt": "Sobering...", "completion": "Very funny."}
{"prompt": "Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.", "completion": "How was the meeting?"}
{"prompt": "It's just across the park.", "completion": "I'm so sorry, honey..."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for everything, Dad.", "completion": "You sure you don't want a ride to work?"}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "To take a picture."}
{"prompt": "Dad!", "completion": "It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip."}
{"prompt": "That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.", "completion": "No.  A deal's a deal."}
{"prompt": "I was afraid you weren't coming.", "completion": "I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  \"The drunk showed up\", that kind of thing..."}
{"prompt": "He sure loves to stay awake.", "completion": "That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep."}
{"prompt": "You do good work, Alice.", "completion": "So did Dan."}
{"prompt": "But how are we gonna --", "completion": "We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late."}
{"prompt": "You think that's the place she's buried?", "completion": "If they actually bothered to bury her."}
{"prompt": "Are you alright?", "completion": "Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy."}
{"prompt": "Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...", "completion": "That's the only reason you're alive..."}
{"prompt": "All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?", "completion": "Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams."}
{"prompt": "And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!", "completion": "What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??"}
{"prompt": "I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.", "completion": "Krueger is reality."}
{"prompt": "I really think you need to calm down now, okay?", "completion": "I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...", "completion": "Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands."}
{"prompt": "You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?", "completion": "I think Krueger's trying to do something to it."}
{"prompt": "I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?", "completion": "Why don't you two stick to reality."}
{"prompt": "It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.", "completion": "No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger."}
{"prompt": "What's that got to do with it?", "completion": "When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story."}
{"prompt": "Did everyone call everyone?", "completion": "They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me."}
{"prompt": "There aren't any little boys on your floor.", "completion": "He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him."}
{"prompt": "Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.", "completion": "Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.", "completion": "It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way."}
{"prompt": "No, the Dan part was nice...", "completion": "Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan."}
{"prompt": "Had kind of a long night.", "completion": "Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl."}
{"prompt": "She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.", "completion": "Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile."}
{"prompt": "No shit.", "completion": "I don't understand."}
{"prompt": "Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?", "completion": "Poor woman..."}
{"prompt": "They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.", "completion": "But I've seen her grave."}
{"prompt": "That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.", "completion": "Meaning?"}
{"prompt": "That's their problem.", "completion": "No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?"}
{"prompt": "Then we'll find another way.", "completion": "They think I'm nuts."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger", "completion": "I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him."}
{"prompt": "I don't know!", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "What, you named it already?", "completion": "Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?"}
{"prompt": "Who's Jacob?", "completion": "My baby!"}
{"prompt": "Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.", "completion": "Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell."}
{"prompt": "Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.", "completion": "It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party."}
{"prompt": "Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?", "completion": "Nobody thinks that."}
{"prompt": "Then get out!", "completion": "Mark!"}
{"prompt": "I thought about that.", "completion": "She must've fallen asleep at the table..."}
{"prompt": "I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...", "completion": "I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?"}
{"prompt": "Mark, are you okay?", "completion": "Yeah.  I'm just aces."}
{"prompt": "I've got to write some of this down.", "completion": "That's why it's my fault Dan's dead."}
{"prompt": "My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.", "completion": "Well we gotta do something!"}
{"prompt": "Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.", "completion": "Greta, come on.  One burger with me?"}
{"prompt": "Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.", "completion": "I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway."}
{"prompt": "Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.", "completion": "I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should."}
{"prompt": "You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?", "completion": "He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes."}
{"prompt": "Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.", "completion": "That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place."}
{"prompt": "My undying love.  Have some.", "completion": "Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?", "completion": "Next life.  Oh, what's that?"}
{"prompt": "Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.", "completion": "All of us.  Right?"}
{"prompt": "Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.", "completion": "Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy."}
{"prompt": "Stop saying that, it's bullshit.", "completion": "I want to talk about the baby."}
{"prompt": "Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?", "completion": "Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night."}
{"prompt": "That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.", "completion": "Have another one, sounds like you need it."}
{"prompt": "All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...", "completion": "Yeah..."}
{"prompt": "These things are wild...  What do you think?", "completion": "Makes you look like a nun--"}
{"prompt": "You, too?", "completion": "He invited me to his house last night."}
{"prompt": "It's okay.", "completion": "Stick around, please?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!", "completion": "I can't listen to this."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!", "completion": "Mark..."}
{"prompt": "Vomit?", "completion": "Faint."}
{"prompt": "Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.", "completion": "Two hours a day, six days a week."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -", "completion": "And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?"}
{"prompt": "But if they <u>do</u>?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Which is the one - we have to worry about?", "completion": "Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all."}
{"prompt": "They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -", "completion": "I'd sooner swim!"}
{"prompt": "That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !", "completion": "- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!"}
{"prompt": "Unidentified Flying Objects.", "completion": "Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'"}
{"prompt": "Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!", "completion": "You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!"}
{"prompt": "Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!", "completion": "You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?"}
{"prompt": "That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!", "completion": "You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...", "completion": "We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!"}
{"prompt": "You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!", "completion": "<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -"}
{"prompt": "What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'", "completion": "Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome..."}
{"prompt": "My father!  He's not - ?", "completion": "Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "Your 'out.'  This came for you."}
{"prompt": "You could train someone else.", "completion": "Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!"}
{"prompt": "It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.", "completion": "And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?"}
{"prompt": "It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.", "completion": "How is he - ?"}
{"prompt": "What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?", "completion": "I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father."}
{"prompt": "Oh it does???", "completion": "Dave - !"}
{"prompt": "I'm with <u>you!</u>", "completion": "Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone."}
{"prompt": "We'll have to look for them later.", "completion": "Well?"}
{"prompt": "Somewhere down there?", "completion": "Wonder where Powell and Carney are?"}
{"prompt": "The sound again?", "completion": "Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?"}
{"prompt": "Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.", "completion": "You hear that?"}
{"prompt": "You know - it <u>is</u>?", "completion": "And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!"}
{"prompt": "Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F", "completion": "Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!"}
{"prompt": "Listen!  Hear that?", "completion": "I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -"}
{"prompt": "Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!", "completion": "I think you're right."}
{"prompt": "Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!", "completion": "How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up."}
{"prompt": "Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---", "completion": "You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look."}
{"prompt": "You've got to let us try, Skipper --", "completion": "'Us?'"}
{"prompt": "We're stuck tight!", "completion": "Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!"}
{"prompt": "Cyclops?", "completion": "Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing."}
{"prompt": "Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?", "completion": "'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!"}
{"prompt": "A lot of people think like that.", "completion": "But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same."}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'"}
{"prompt": "I guess.", "completion": "One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs."}
{"prompt": "I might have a son like <u>that!</u>", "completion": "I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?"}
{"prompt": "You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?", "completion": "Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!"}
{"prompt": "At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -", "completion": "<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?"}
{"prompt": "Reef!", "completion": "So they caught up with you, too?"}
{"prompt": "But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!", "completion": "Helen.  I appeal to you -"}
{"prompt": "We hope!", "completion": "Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -"}
{"prompt": "With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --", "completion": "Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead."}
{"prompt": "You better take Powell and Carney with you --", "completion": "The frogmen?"}
{"prompt": "What course, Skipper?", "completion": "Right at our one-eyed friend!"}
{"prompt": "A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!", "completion": "What???"}
{"prompt": "Course and speed?", "completion": "Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!"}
{"prompt": "What about down?", "completion": "I...don't know!"}
{"prompt": "Is there any way out of it?", "completion": "Seems to be all around..."}
{"prompt": "Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.", "completion": "Right, Skipper."}
{"prompt": "We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!", "completion": "What????"}
{"prompt": "The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.", "completion": "Why do you say that?"}
{"prompt": "Skipper - could you take a look here...?", "completion": "Something wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, Griff?", "completion": "All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor."}
{"prompt": "What about time...?", "completion": "Excuse me, Skipper---"}
{"prompt": "Anything ---", "completion": "It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole."}
{"prompt": "Radiation level...constantly rising...", "completion": "Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot..."}
{"prompt": "That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!", "completion": "Now they feel it...down below."}
{"prompt": "We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!", "completion": "Wonderful!"}
{"prompt": "All ready?", "completion": "As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper."}
{"prompt": "There's got to be an explanation!", "completion": "There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!"}
{"prompt": "What direction does the system indicate?", "completion": "As we near the Pole..."}
{"prompt": "If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....", "completion": "The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!"}
{"prompt": "The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!", "completion": "....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?"}
{"prompt": "We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?", "completion": "<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale...."}
{"prompt": "Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!", "completion": "What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?"}
{"prompt": "High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...", "completion": "...above Murmansk, and Finland."}
{"prompt": "It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?", "completion": "Under <u>water</u>?"}
{"prompt": "What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?", "completion": "Minus three."}
{"prompt": "Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!", "completion": "Nothing we can do, now."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?"}
{"prompt": "And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!", "completion": "Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?"}
{"prompt": "A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....", "completion": "It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom."}
{"prompt": "But - what can we accomplish?", "completion": "We can <u>ram</u> him!"}
{"prompt": "Right <u>at</u> him?", "completion": "That's what I said!"}
{"prompt": "What's the running time?", "completion": "Thirty-four seconds!"}
{"prompt": "You're sure it's Cyclops?", "completion": "Take a look."}
{"prompt": "Determine extent of damage, immediately.", "completion": "After torpedo room:  Report!"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think I should have joined the Air Force!"}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "It'll be all right.  We're old friends!"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -", "completion": "'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?"}
{"prompt": "I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.", "completion": "Who with?"}
{"prompt": "I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.", "completion": "I met Dr. Kent, once."}
{"prompt": "<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!", "completion": "Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper."}
{"prompt": "To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?", "completion": "Obviously."}
{"prompt": "That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?", "completion": "Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --"}
{"prompt": "I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'", "completion": "It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself."}
{"prompt": "On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "I am afraid not.  Therefore -", "completion": "Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?"}
{"prompt": "Your friend was to remain where he was!", "completion": "He did!"}
{"prompt": "- for horrors like yourself?", "completion": "Swell!"}
{"prompt": "Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?", "completion": "My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -"}
{"prompt": "That's a <u>face</u>???", "completion": "Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you."}
{"prompt": "Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!", "completion": "Come where?"}
{"prompt": "Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.", "completion": "All right - go to it."}
{"prompt": "Due north.  At five knots...no, six!", "completion": "Toward the Pole!"}
{"prompt": "We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.", "completion": "But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!"}
{"prompt": "You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!", "completion": "Or, perhaps, until he gets us?"}
{"prompt": "Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.", "completion": "Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll be - !", "completion": "I'll be another!"}
{"prompt": "See what?", "completion": "The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle..."}
{"prompt": "My yeoman will show you to your quarters.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.", "completion": "All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town."}
{"prompt": "Twombley involved?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "What is the Northcountry Development Association?", "completion": "I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league."}
{"prompt": "As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.", "completion": "This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?"}
{"prompt": "I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.", "completion": "Has anybody offered to buy it?"}
{"prompt": "You don't believe me?", "completion": "About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?"}
{"prompt": "...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.", "completion": "Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him."}
{"prompt": "Always has been.", "completion": "This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things."}
{"prompt": "Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.", "completion": "Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town."}
{"prompt": "Are you alright, Wade?", "completion": "Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay."}
{"prompt": "Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?", "completion": "No. Black."}
{"prompt": "He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.", "completion": "You got yourself a computer, Alma."}
{"prompt": "Chub says you're fired.", "completion": "He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning."}
{"prompt": "LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?", "completion": "Tell me."}
{"prompt": "-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.", "completion": "Yeah. I know about that."}
{"prompt": "The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --", "completion": "Just tell me when you'll have it fixed."}
{"prompt": "What are you boys up to?", "completion": "Same old shit."}
{"prompt": "You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --", "completion": "Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred."}
{"prompt": "Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.", "completion": "Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?"}
{"prompt": "No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.", "completion": "It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?"}
{"prompt": "How soon?", "completion": "This spring."}
{"prompt": "It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.", "completion": "I plan to. Soon."}
{"prompt": "That was me.", "completion": "I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father."}
{"prompt": "You can't buy Wade off.", "completion": "We bought you."}
{"prompt": "Shit! What are we gonna do?", "completion": "Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel."}
{"prompt": "No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.", "completion": "He's on to us!"}
{"prompt": "You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.", "completion": "Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?"}
{"prompt": "Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?", "completion": "Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me."}
{"prompt": "Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.", "completion": "This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You see it?"}
{"prompt": "You heard the news.", "completion": "I hear Twombley got shot."}
{"prompt": "Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.", "completion": "You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks."}
{"prompt": "Sun's gettin high.", "completion": "Deers have ears too."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "This way."}
{"prompt": "Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.", "completion": "Safety on?"}
{"prompt": "The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "They said.", "completion": "Hmm."}
{"prompt": "Pitcher. \"Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.\"", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "Double A. New Britain.", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "Drafted by the Red Sox.", "completion": "You played for the Sox?"}
{"prompt": "I used to play ball.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "I'm okay.", "completion": "Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow."}
{"prompt": "And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.", "completion": "Wonderful!"}
{"prompt": "You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.", "completion": "I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time."}
{"prompt": "You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.", "completion": "Mmm."}
{"prompt": "You think so.", "completion": "You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You might not kill it."}
{"prompt": "Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.", "completion": "If you get it?"}
{"prompt": "Damn straight!", "completion": "Done much shooting with that rifle yet?"}
{"prompt": "Guaranteed, eh?", "completion": "Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?"}
{"prompt": "It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.", "completion": "Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten."}
{"prompt": "I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.", "completion": "What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?", "completion": "Open the door. We're late."}
{"prompt": "Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.", "completion": "Open the door, will ya?"}
{"prompt": "I'm fucking out of here.", "completion": "Lawford?"}
{"prompt": "Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.", "completion": "He sure as hell won't."}
{"prompt": "There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.", "completion": "Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man."}
{"prompt": "Saw him do it?", "completion": "What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that."}
{"prompt": "Sure you did.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.", "completion": "Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said."}
{"prompt": "I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?", "completion": "Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off."}
{"prompt": "On your sleeve.", "completion": "Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?"}
{"prompt": "Where'd you get the blood?", "completion": "What blood?"}
{"prompt": "You stayed away?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.", "completion": "The ambulance guys lugged him up."}
{"prompt": "No, I mean whereabouts.", "completion": "A half mile in, along the old lumber road."}
{"prompt": "Where'd Twombley get shot?", "completion": "In the chest."}
{"prompt": "Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?", "completion": "Piece of fucking cake."}
{"prompt": "Bastard's got his high beams on.", "completion": "Shit."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.", "completion": "Right!"}
{"prompt": "Like you and Gordon?", "completion": "Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me."}
{"prompt": "How'd you get the job?", "completion": "Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy."}
{"prompt": "Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.", "completion": "Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there."}
{"prompt": "Not here.", "completion": "Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --"}
{"prompt": "You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.", "completion": "Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems."}
{"prompt": "I thought I told you to move that truck!", "completion": "Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?"}
{"prompt": "No brag. Just fact.", "completion": "Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?"}
{"prompt": "LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.", "completion": "Where's that gun you were bragging on today?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, let's go home, then.", "completion": "Don't mind if I do."}
{"prompt": "Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.", "completion": "I want to go home."}
{"prompt": "Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "You're a policeman."}
{"prompt": "You can't.", "completion": "That's illegal, you know."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.", "completion": "I want to go home."}
{"prompt": "Please don't cry. Please, honey.", "completion": "What are you sorry for?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Fine."}
{"prompt": "Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?", "completion": "Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's."}
{"prompt": "Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --", "completion": "I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though."}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "What do you want, then?"}
{"prompt": "Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.", "completion": "C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "How about a Big Mac?"}
{"prompt": "Pop?", "completion": "Grandpa. My father. It's his."}
{"prompt": "It's pretty old.", "completion": "It belongs to Pop."}
{"prompt": "Are we going in this?", "completion": "Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine."}
{"prompt": "Dad.", "completion": "I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?"}
{"prompt": "Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.", "completion": "That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "That's all you got to say? \"Yes\"."}
{"prompt": "Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.", "completion": "She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?", "completion": "I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me."}
{"prompt": "Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?", "completion": "See, I knew you'd be mad."}
{"prompt": "Jesus, why?", "completion": "I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me."}
{"prompt": "What? You called Mommy? Just now?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.", "completion": "I called Mommy."}
{"prompt": "You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.", "completion": "I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home."}
{"prompt": "No what?", "completion": "No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home."}
{"prompt": "Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I want to go home.  I don't like it here.", "completion": "Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam."}
{"prompt": "It's stupid.", "completion": "It's fun."}
{"prompt": "It's not that.", "completion": "What then?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to.", "completion": "Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long."}
{"prompt": "No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.", "completion": "Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know."}
{"prompt": "I just think you used to be bad.", "completion": "No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?"}
{"prompt": "I bet you did lots of bad things.", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "But it's not funny now.", "completion": "It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change."}
{"prompt": "Was it funny?", "completion": "To us it was."}
{"prompt": "Did you do that when you were a kid?", "completion": "Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's stupid.", "completion": "I guess they're stupid."}
{"prompt": "You know.", "completion": "Break stuff?"}
{"prompt": "Why do they do that?", "completion": "Do what?"}
{"prompt": "I don't care. They're out.", "completion": "Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ."}
{"prompt": "Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.", "completion": "Those are the Hoyts."}
{"prompt": "Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.", "completion": "I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember."}
{"prompt": "You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?", "completion": "The key, Wade."}
{"prompt": "Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.", "completion": "Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys."}
{"prompt": "You and Mel Gordon?", "completion": "Could be."}
{"prompt": "I won't. You interested?", "completion": "Maybe."}
{"prompt": "Want to buy?", "completion": "Don't light that in here. I'm allergic."}
{"prompt": "That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.", "completion": "What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?"}
{"prompt": "You? Why?", "completion": "Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal."}
{"prompt": "He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.", "completion": "Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me."}
{"prompt": "I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.", "completion": "So?"}
{"prompt": "What do I have to do for it?", "completion": "Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little."}
{"prompt": "On what you pay me?", "completion": "Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch."}
{"prompt": "Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.", "completion": "You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?"}
{"prompt": "I'm fine, fine.", "completion": "You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?"}
{"prompt": "Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.", "completion": "How you holding up, Wade?"}
{"prompt": "Something bugging you?", "completion": "Yeah. A few things."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.", "completion": "It ain't done, if that's what you mean."}
{"prompt": "You want me to follow them to Littleton?", "completion": "Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling."}
{"prompt": "Like hell.", "completion": "That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley."}
{"prompt": "I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.", "completion": "You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit."}
{"prompt": "He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.", "completion": "I shoulda sent you instead of Jack."}
{"prompt": "You mean Twombley?", "completion": "Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."}
{"prompt": "Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.", "completion": "Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?"}
{"prompt": "Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.", "completion": "Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?"}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "I figured you already heard."}
{"prompt": "What's the hurry?", "completion": "A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you.", "completion": "That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody."}
{"prompt": "I'm not saying that.", "completion": "Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left."}
{"prompt": "What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.", "completion": "You don't want the extra police pay?"}
{"prompt": "At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.", "completion": "Don't go playing policeman."}
{"prompt": "His son-in-law damn near killed me.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Where's the plow?", "completion": "Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley."}
{"prompt": "Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.", "completion": "Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader."}
{"prompt": "Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.", "completion": "Tomorrow, Gordon."}
{"prompt": "You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.", "completion": "We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!"}
{"prompt": "You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.", "completion": "Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?"}
{"prompt": "Hi honey.", "completion": "No problem. Look, I..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, lots.", "completion": "See. Get your boots."}
{"prompt": "Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.", "completion": "Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?"}
{"prompt": "We've done all our talking, Wade.", "completion": "It's just..."}
{"prompt": "No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.", "completion": "We should talk."}
{"prompt": "I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?", "completion": "You ever come to your father's grave anymore?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want her to go, Lillian.", "completion": "Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse."}
{"prompt": "She's grown up some, hasn't she?", "completion": "Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake."}
{"prompt": "While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --", "completion": "Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?"}
{"prompt": "Lillian!", "completion": "Where's Jill?"}
{"prompt": "I still don't understand --", "completion": "From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned."}
{"prompt": "Good. Who?", "completion": "Mel Gordon."}
{"prompt": "Did you get his number?", "completion": "I know who it is."}
{"prompt": "Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?", "completion": "Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody."}
{"prompt": "Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.", "completion": "Don't be silly. Hi, Jill."}
{"prompt": "Going somewhere, Margie?", "completion": "I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat."}
{"prompt": "I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?", "completion": "Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit."}
{"prompt": "What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?", "completion": "It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry."}
{"prompt": "This is nuts.", "completion": "Wade."}
{"prompt": "How?", "completion": "I don't know for Christ's sake!"}
{"prompt": "Think they're alright?", "completion": "Of course! I would've heard."}
{"prompt": "The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.", "completion": "Strange."}
{"prompt": "I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.", "completion": "Are you sure they're home? Did you call?"}
{"prompt": "Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?", "completion": "I know your parents."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "Did you tell them?  That we were coming?"}
{"prompt": "It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?", "completion": "Alright. I'll think about it."}
{"prompt": "I've been thinking about it, that's all.", "completion": "You've been married twice --"}
{"prompt": "There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.", "completion": "Oh, Wade."}
{"prompt": "I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.", "completion": "Then... I guess you have to."}
{"prompt": "It's nice.", "completion": "Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?"}
{"prompt": "What way?", "completion": "After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person."}
{"prompt": "You knew me as a kid.", "completion": "Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way."}
{"prompt": "But not now.", "completion": "I can see what you looked like as a kid."}
{"prompt": "You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.", "completion": "No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know."}
{"prompt": "The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?", "completion": "No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age."}
{"prompt": "Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?", "completion": "Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia."}
{"prompt": "Jack doesn't need money.", "completion": "Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that."}
{"prompt": "Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?", "completion": "Money."}
{"prompt": "...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.", "completion": "I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose."}
{"prompt": "I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...", "completion": "I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did."}
{"prompt": "Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.", "completion": "There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually."}
{"prompt": "Tonight. Let's get together.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.", "completion": "Call me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I mean that.", "completion": "No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?", "completion": "You don't mean that."}
{"prompt": "Forget it.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Said what?", "completion": "About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I'm sorry about what I said."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "See you tomorrow, maybe.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.", "completion": "Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break."}
{"prompt": "How's she doing?", "completion": "Okay. She's fine."}
{"prompt": "New hat?  Jill's up, I see.", "completion": "For a while."}
{"prompt": "Can --?", "completion": "Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze."}
{"prompt": "Is...? She's dead then?", "completion": "It makes me sad."}
{"prompt": "Coffee's perked.", "completion": "When did she die?"}
{"prompt": "It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.", "completion": "Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?"}
{"prompt": "There's a furnace.", "completion": "You're not using it today?"}
{"prompt": "You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!", "completion": "Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove."}
{"prompt": "Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.", "completion": "Yes. Here's your ticket."}
{"prompt": "You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?", "completion": "Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --"}
{"prompt": "Hold on!", "completion": "Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon."}
{"prompt": "Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?", "completion": "Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--"}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you talking about?", "completion": "I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation."}
{"prompt": "I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'", "completion": "Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment."}
{"prompt": "Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.", "completion": "How's that?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.", "completion": "Can't it wait, then?"}
{"prompt": "Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.", "completion": "Something about my father?"}
{"prompt": "Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.", "completion": "Mrs. Gordon. Thank you."}
{"prompt": "I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?", "completion": "He's asleep. We were up very late."}
{"prompt": "No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I guess -- that's what he said.", "completion": "He got his deer yet?"}
{"prompt": "Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.", "completion": "His office. You mean my old office."}
{"prompt": "Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?", "completion": "It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub."}
{"prompt": "CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?", "completion": "No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go."}
{"prompt": "The other guy.", "completion": "Where... how'd you hear that?"}
{"prompt": "The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.", "completion": "Jack?"}
{"prompt": "You talked to Jack?", "completion": "Not since last night. He took a guy hunting."}
{"prompt": "That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.", "completion": "Marg! You got orders!"}
{"prompt": "Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with \"Home Made Cooking\", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.", "completion": "Marg!"}
{"prompt": "I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.", "completion": "This town sucks."}
{"prompt": "The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.", "completion": "Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it."}
{"prompt": "It don't look right.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Take care, Wade.", "completion": "You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know."}
{"prompt": "Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!", "completion": "I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you."}
{"prompt": "Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!", "completion": "Crawl!"}
{"prompt": "Bang!", "completion": "You and me."}
{"prompt": "Everything you know is from me.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Love! I'm made of love!", "completion": "Call it what you want."}
{"prompt": "Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!", "completion": "Love! What the fuck do you know about love?"}
{"prompt": "You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!", "completion": "You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you."}
{"prompt": "Pop, for Christ's sake!", "completion": "You think you can take me now? Come on, try."}
{"prompt": "Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.", "completion": "Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head."}
{"prompt": "Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?", "completion": "Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was."}
{"prompt": "Is there something wrong with the phone?", "completion": "In the living room."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater."}
{"prompt": "Where's Ma?", "completion": "She's coming."}
{"prompt": "We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?", "completion": "How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while."}
{"prompt": "Sleeping.", "completion": "You remember Margie Fogg?"}
{"prompt": "You no-good pup!", "completion": "Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?"}
{"prompt": "What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Just do it.", "completion": "Atta-go."}
{"prompt": "Rolfe.", "completion": "A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!"}
{"prompt": "To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?", "completion": "Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this."}
{"prompt": "I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.", "completion": "For what?"}
{"prompt": "Wade, are you alright?", "completion": "But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office."}
{"prompt": "That's what you think.", "completion": "Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another."}
{"prompt": "Well, I never heard that one.", "completion": "I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence."}
{"prompt": "We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.", "completion": "And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft."}
{"prompt": "You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?", "completion": "It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne."}
{"prompt": "Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?", "completion": "It may have happened, but not the way you said."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened."}
{"prompt": "I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?", "completion": "I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after."}
{"prompt": "Not particularly.", "completion": "Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?"}
{"prompt": "Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.", "completion": "It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?"}
{"prompt": "So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.", "completion": "A hunting accident is perfect."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?", "completion": "Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. You tell me.", "completion": "Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?"}
{"prompt": "Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.", "completion": "They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?"}
{"prompt": "Motive. You gotta have a motive.", "completion": "Money."}
{"prompt": "Then who shot him?", "completion": "Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt."}
{"prompt": "Which is?", "completion": "That it wasn't an accident."}
{"prompt": "Find them everywhere.", "completion": "I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one."}
{"prompt": "I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.", "completion": "Want to know what I think happened?"}
{"prompt": "I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.", "completion": "Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?"}
{"prompt": "Well, do you still plan to get married?", "completion": "Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it."}
{"prompt": "What about Margie?", "completion": "What about her?"}
{"prompt": "No thanks. I don't drink.", "completion": "Yeah. I forgot."}
{"prompt": "What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?", "completion": "Anyone else want one? Rolfe?"}
{"prompt": "No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.", "completion": "Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess."}
{"prompt": "I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.", "completion": "Haven't you already done a bit of that?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess.", "completion": "Get some sleep."}
{"prompt": "A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.", "completion": "Don't think about it. You're exhausted."}
{"prompt": "Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "The night before the shooting.", "completion": "How was she?"}
{"prompt": "Lillian was here. In Lawford.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it was an accident.", "completion": "They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body."}
{"prompt": "No shit.", "completion": "You think Jack shot him?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Twombley."}
{"prompt": "It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.", "completion": "He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business."}
{"prompt": "Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.", "completion": "No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did."}
{"prompt": "There was something. It happened up your way.", "completion": "Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend."}
{"prompt": "Wade?", "completion": "Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?"}
{"prompt": "Jim... for godsake!", "completion": "Rolfe."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.", "completion": "Daddy. Daddy, please..."}
{"prompt": "Mom?", "completion": "Yes dear?"}
{"prompt": "You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.", "completion": "Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek."}
{"prompt": "Some kids were teasing you?", "completion": "That's not really the point."}
{"prompt": "Your father never means to be so...", "completion": "I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important."}
{"prompt": "No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?", "completion": "When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One."}
{"prompt": "He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.", "completion": "I'm sorry, honey."}
{"prompt": "We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.", "completion": "I know, Mom.  It was great... really."}
{"prompt": "You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...", "completion": "Back at The Fishbowl?"}
{"prompt": "Alice...", "completion": "Mom, just this once, give it a rest."}
{"prompt": "Don't you even want to ask?", "completion": "Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream."}
{"prompt": "You don't want to say hi to your father?", "completion": "I'm sure he's busy."}
{"prompt": "Well, you aren't the President, dear.", "completion": "Yeah, no duh."}
{"prompt": "You are a resilient man, Mr.", "completion": "It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times."}
{"prompt": "It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.", "completion": "He didn't leave us."}
{"prompt": "That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?", "completion": "Fuck off, you stupid asshole."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.", "completion": "The woman you shot. She was my friend."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.", "completion": "Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?"}
{"prompt": "You're one of Stravanavitch's men.", "completion": "So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age."}
{"prompt": "You must be tired. It'll wake you up.", "completion": "No, thank you. The gunfire did that."}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'm slowing us down.", "completion": "I don't drink coffee."}
{"prompt": "It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.", "completion": "There they are!"}
{"prompt": "Been better, Dad... You?", "completion": "Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god..."}
{"prompt": "Alice... I...", "completion": "How you doing, sweetie?"}
{"prompt": "Daddy...", "completion": "Daddy..."}
{"prompt": "How `bout a hug for the old man.", "completion": "Alice!"}
{"prompt": "How was...  ...the ballet?", "completion": "It was the experience of a lifetime."}
{"prompt": "Oooooh, I'm good.", "completion": "Hey, you guys back already?"}
{"prompt": "The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.", "completion": "Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated."}
{"prompt": "They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.", "completion": "The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner."}
{"prompt": "Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.", "completion": "It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement."}
{"prompt": "The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.", "completion": "Did we warn them off?"}
{"prompt": "It's cut.", "completion": "cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out."}
{"prompt": "Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.", "completion": "Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?"}
{"prompt": "Got it.", "completion": "Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up."}
{"prompt": "Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.", "completion": "Do you see the maintenance panel?"}
{"prompt": "Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.", "completion": "Sluggish... I think it's jammed too."}
{"prompt": "No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.", "completion": "Lemme take a look."}
{"prompt": "Uh, we got a problem here.", "completion": "Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in."}
{"prompt": "How we doing, Colonel?", "completion": "We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way."}
{"prompt": "Got it.", "completion": "Stay cool."}
{"prompt": "Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.", "completion": "Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?"}
{"prompt": "Who's flying the fucking plane?", "completion": "I'm doing what I can."}
{"prompt": "Put your pilot on.", "completion": "He's busy being dead."}
{"prompt": "Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.", "completion": "You read my mind."}
{"prompt": "U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.", "completion": "Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party."}
{"prompt": "I prefered the terrorists.", "completion": "That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice."}
{"prompt": "This doesn't make sense.", "completion": "They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel."}
{"prompt": "That kid's name was Jim Marshall.", "completion": "They aren't answering their hails."}
{"prompt": "Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.", "completion": "Walter, if you have a point, make it."}
{"prompt": "He's dead then. They must have killed him.", "completion": "We don't know that."}
{"prompt": "The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.", "completion": "An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in."}
{"prompt": "Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.", "completion": "Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls."}
{"prompt": "It was a good ad-lib, sir.", "completion": "Thanks.  Wrote it last night."}
{"prompt": "Sir, you threw out page two.", "completion": "Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?"}
{"prompt": "The Chief Justice? What on earth for?", "completion": "To swear you in as President."}
{"prompt": "Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.", "completion": "If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage."}
{"prompt": "Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.", "completion": "If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.", "completion": "They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?"}
{"prompt": "But they start executing hostages in", "completion": "I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff."}
{"prompt": "Can we do that?", "completion": "We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace."}
{"prompt": "General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.", "completion": "Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?"}
{"prompt": "You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.", "completion": "My loyalty was never to my country."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because it is my duty."}
{"prompt": "Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?", "completion": "Yes, Mr. President."}
{"prompt": "That's affirmative.", "completion": "Ga get it."}
{"prompt": "Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.", "completion": "Roger."}

{"prompt": "Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.", "completion": "About goddamn time."}
{"prompt": "Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.", "completion": "No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House."}
{"prompt": "Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.", "completion": "Where are we now?"}
{"prompt": "We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.", "completion": "We're not going to make it."}
{"prompt": "Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.", "completion": "Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs."}
{"prompt": "Well it worked.", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "why did they do that?", "completion": "Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us."}
{"prompt": "A secret service agent. It must be.", "completion": "Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable."}
{"prompt": "Who did this?", "completion": "We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for."}
{"prompt": "Nine.", "completion": "Any of us?"}
{"prompt": "Dead.", "completion": "How many others killed?"}
{"prompt": "Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.", "completion": "The rest of the secret service?"}
{"prompt": "Copy, Air Force One.", "completion": "We've already been inspected."}
{"prompt": "Tower, here.", "completion": "This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard."}
{"prompt": "Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.", "completion": "We copy. Stand by...  Tower?"}
{"prompt": "Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.", "completion": "Stand by."}
{"prompt": "Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.", "completion": "Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal."}
{"prompt": "You're pointing a gun at me.", "completion": "Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell."}
{"prompt": "How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?", "completion": "Scared. We're scared."}

{"prompt": "Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "And all these rooms here?", "completion": "Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center."}
{"prompt": "A dubious distinction, no?", "completion": "I guess it depends on your perspective."}
{"prompt": "This is a remarkable aircraft.", "completion": "You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary."}
{"prompt": "The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.", "completion": "Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to."}
{"prompt": "You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.", "completion": "Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person."}
{"prompt": "Three...", "completion": "You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?"}
{"prompt": "Four...", "completion": "Jim..."}
{"prompt": "The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.", "completion": "Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone."}
{"prompt": "Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.", "completion": "You will be the first to pay for that mistake."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Say something dear."}
{"prompt": "So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.", "completion": "Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here."}
{"prompt": "But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.", "completion": "That was war."}
{"prompt": "I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.", "completion": "How can you? I mean they're people."}
{"prompt": "Yes", "completion": "Why? Do you enjoy it?"}
{"prompt": "Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.", "completion": "Do you have to be so brutal?"}
{"prompt": "I know he left you behind.", "completion": "My husband is a very courageous man."}
{"prompt": "Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...", "completion": "What do you know of my husband?"}
{"prompt": "Come on, Alice.", "completion": "Leave my daughter alone."}
{"prompt": "Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.", "completion": "Now, or he dies, please."}
{"prompt": "Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.", "completion": "What do you want with us?"}
{"prompt": "No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.", "completion": "Hold on, Alice."}
{"prompt": "Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!", "completion": "If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down."}
{"prompt": "One thing I've learned as", "completion": "There goes your ride."}
{"prompt": "You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to", "completion": "The taste of defeat is bitter, no?"}
{"prompt": "Good. Good.", "completion": "Someday, you'll regret my nature."}
{"prompt": "You'll do it?", "completion": "Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone."}
{"prompt": "Pity. Mr. Gibbs.", "completion": "Stop."}
{"prompt": "Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.", "completion": "This administration does not negotiate with terrorists."}
{"prompt": "No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.", "completion": "She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me."}
{"prompt": "Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.", "completion": "Over my dead body."}
{"prompt": "Finally, we can bargain.", "completion": "I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel."}
{"prompt": "Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.", "completion": "Yes. You've made yourself quite clear."}
{"prompt": "Twenty minutes?", "completion": "You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads."}
{"prompt": "Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.", "completion": "Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Sir, we stay with the President.", "completion": "That isn't necessary."}
{"prompt": "I'll not going without my family.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.", "completion": "Got it."}
{"prompt": "They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.", "completion": "Get `em ready.  You... come with me."}
{"prompt": "We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.", "completion": "We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane..."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?", "completion": "Gravity."}
{"prompt": "The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.", "completion": "Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me."}
{"prompt": "Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.", "completion": "They've gotta be joking."}
{"prompt": "Flying the plane.", "completion": "You haven't even driven a car since you took office."}
{"prompt": "Both of you.", "completion": "What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Please... don't start with me.", "completion": "Call Petrov...  I'll be back."}
{"prompt": "Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?", "completion": "I don't know why you stayed."}
{"prompt": "Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.", "completion": "Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer."}
{"prompt": "This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.", "completion": "How did your speech go?"}
{"prompt": "I'll make it up to you, I promise.", "completion": "I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut."}
{"prompt": "But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.", "completion": "I wish it were that easy..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I miss you. And I miss her."}
{"prompt": "And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?", "completion": "You know what?"}
{"prompt": "She's a big girl.  She understands.", "completion": "How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks."}
{"prompt": "Rose, I don't have time for this.", "completion": "For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person."}
{"prompt": "No, Mr. President.  It can't.", "completion": "Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it."}
{"prompt": "May I speak to you for a moment?", "completion": "Can't it wait?"}
{"prompt": "Someone should give you a raise.", "completion": "Actually, sir, you could be that someone."}
{"prompt": "Where are we sending it?", "completion": "White House Situation room."}
{"prompt": "No good. I said they disabled the communications system.", "completion": "No. I thought about this, Mr."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me?", "completion": "The fax machines."}
{"prompt": "Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?", "completion": "The fax machines."}
{"prompt": "But this is different, sir. You're the President.", "completion": "Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?"}
{"prompt": "and if that means negotiating...", "completion": "You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target."}
{"prompt": "They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.", "completion": "Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway."}
{"prompt": "Two... THREE. GO!", "completion": "Did they say anything about my family?"}
{"prompt": "One.", "completion": "But..."}

{"prompt": "Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.", "completion": "You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right.", "completion": "Don't cut me off. This is an emergency."}
{"prompt": "who can I say is calling?", "completion": "This is the President."}
{"prompt": "White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.", "completion": "Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?"}
{"prompt": "WE'RE HOOKED!", "completion": "We're hooked. Hove into position."}
{"prompt": "IT'S OPEN!", "completion": "DO YOU SEE TEEM?"}
{"prompt": "Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.", "completion": "They better. Fuel's almost gone."}
{"prompt": "How long's it been since you flew, sir?", "completion": "Twenty-five years."}
{"prompt": "Iraq? Shep, you're fired.", "completion": "Shit."}
{"prompt": "A MiG? Where the hell are we?", "completion": "Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq."}
{"prompt": "Sir...", "completion": "My god. I think that was a MiG."}
{"prompt": "I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?", "completion": "Shepherd."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?", "completion": "Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room."}
{"prompt": "That's my job.", "completion": "Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation."}
{"prompt": "We'll just say it was in bad taste.", "completion": "You give me ulcers."}
{"prompt": "Did we tape the Duke game?", "completion": "I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please."}
{"prompt": "It's bait.  Don't take it.", "completion": "Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging."}
{"prompt": "Other way around, sir.", "completion": "Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press."}
{"prompt": "*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.", "completion": "This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns."}
{"prompt": "With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.", "completion": "I might still have a few chips left."}
{"prompt": "No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?", "completion": "He and the NRA don't like the wording."}
{"prompt": "I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.", "completion": "You wanna knock of f?"}
{"prompt": "Commissioner, Aquarius.", "completion": "*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch."}
{"prompt": "I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.", "completion": "Kruger, Sagittarius."}
{"prompt": "What's the story?", "completion": "Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor..."}
{"prompt": "Forget it.  I was reading.", "completion": "I was reading too."}
{"prompt": "I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...", "completion": "You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!"}
{"prompt": "That just doesn't make any sense.", "completion": "I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one."}
{"prompt": "I just wish it was that simple.", "completion": "That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago."}
{"prompt": "Commissioner.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.", "completion": "You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board."}
{"prompt": "Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.", "completion": "And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them."}
{"prompt": "Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.", "completion": "Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing."}
{"prompt": "Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?", "completion": "What is it, Mary?"}
{"prompt": "Yes I did...", "completion": "Felt like a large asteroid."}
{"prompt": "You better take this.", "completion": "Did you feel that?"}
{"prompt": "Dunn.", "completion": "Sir?"}
{"prompt": "Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.", "completion": "You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship."}
{"prompt": "We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.", "completion": "You better check it, Unger."}
{"prompt": "Shut down accelerators.", "completion": "Accelerators down."}
{"prompt": "Oveur.", "completion": "Dunn."}
{"prompt": "Ted, the lever!", "completion": "Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand."}
{"prompt": "Now!", "completion": "Compute!"}
{"prompt": "We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!", "completion": "Set!"}
{"prompt": "Not when I'm with you, Ted.", "completion": "I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this."}
{"prompt": "The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.", "completion": "Are you afraid?"}
{"prompt": "That's right -- premature ejection.", "completion": "What will happen to him, Ted?"}
{"prompt": "Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.", "completion": "You mean..."}
{"prompt": "That might be the news we've been waiting for.", "completion": "Simon just ejected!"}
{"prompt": "Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.", "completion": "I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will."}
{"prompt": "Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.", "completion": "That was very well put, Ted."}
{"prompt": "Not now, Elaine.", "completion": "I mean until we start to burn up."}
{"prompt": "Ted, please be careful.", "completion": "Ted, we've only got ten minutes."}
{"prompt": "Ted, there's no time to explain.", "completion": "Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can."}
{"prompt": "Ted!", "completion": "Elaine, what's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.", "completion": "Elaine!"}
{"prompt": "I'd use the word insane.", "completion": "There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg."}
{"prompt": "The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.", "completion": "What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face."}
{"prompt": "I've never used the word insane, Ted.", "completion": "What word would you use, Elaine?"}
{"prompt": "Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.", "completion": "Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane."}
{"prompt": "We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.", "completion": "Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum."}
{"prompt": "Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.", "completion": "Elaine, we have to go back."}
{"prompt": "Ted!", "completion": "Elaine."}
{"prompt": "Ted.", "completion": "Not now, Elaine!"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing, Ted?", "completion": "I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!"}
{"prompt": "Ted, we're taking off!", "completion": "Let me by, Elaine."}
{"prompt": "Ted!  What are you...?", "completion": "I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight."}
{"prompt": "That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.", "completion": "Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you."}
{"prompt": "No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.", "completion": "If that's the way you want it."}
{"prompt": "His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.", "completion": "Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon."}
{"prompt": "Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.", "completion": "And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now."}
{"prompt": "Who's that, Ted?", "completion": "Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since."}
{"prompt": "Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.", "completion": "Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better."}
{"prompt": "Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.", "completion": "Elaine, what happened to us?"}
{"prompt": "You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!", "completion": "Elaine."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing wrong with me!", "completion": "Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti."}
{"prompt": "Ask Simon.", "completion": "Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground."}
{"prompt": "I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.", "completion": "Ted, what's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "It's got to be stopped!", "completion": "But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out."}
{"prompt": "Te...!", "completion": "That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.", "completion": "Elaine."}
{"prompt": "The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.", "completion": "Is he making any progress, Doctor?"}
{"prompt": "You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.", "completion": "Is that a good sign, Doctor?"}
{"prompt": "You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.", "completion": "I mean for Ted."}
{"prompt": "So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.", "completion": "What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?"}
{"prompt": "Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.", "completion": "The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe.", "completion": "Simon, what are you saying?!"}
{"prompt": "Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?", "completion": "Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there."}
{"prompt": "We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.", "completion": "My career is shot."}
{"prompt": "He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.", "completion": "Can't we change course?"}
{"prompt": "Roger.", "completion": "Simon, what's happening?!"}
{"prompt": "That's my girl.", "completion": "Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit."}
{"prompt": "Have you got it straightened out now?", "completion": "I think so."}
{"prompt": "Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.", "completion": "Don't be too long."}
{"prompt": "Simon, why has he become so... so...", "completion": "So mentally ill?"}
{"prompt": "No, I've been excited before.", "completion": "Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East."}
{"prompt": "I'm so excited, Simon.", "completion": "I guess this is a first for you."}
{"prompt": "You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.", "completion": "Frank's the best pilot in the program."}
{"prompt": "Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.", "completion": "But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe."}
{"prompt": "Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.", "completion": "And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman."}
{"prompt": "For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.", "completion": "Simon."}
{"prompt": "No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.", "completion": "Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit."}
{"prompt": "You can do it from up here, Captain.", "completion": "I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine."}
{"prompt": "We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.", "completion": "Roger."}
{"prompt": "I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.", "completion": "I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?"}
{"prompt": "Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.", "completion": "There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>."}
{"prompt": "Request; life support systems check.", "completion": "Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that."}
{"prompt": "Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.", "completion": "Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I..."}
{"prompt": "Go ahead.", "completion": "You have great tits."}
{"prompt": "That's okay, ROK.", "completion": "Can I say something of a personal nature to you?"}
{"prompt": "Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.", "completion": "Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago."}
{"prompt": "Negative.", "completion": "That's not possible."}
{"prompt": "Negative.", "completion": "That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis."}

{"prompt": "I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.", "completion": "I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury."}
{"prompt": "Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?", "completion": "We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "He's a boy dog."}
{"prompt": "Scraps.", "completion": "Can I hold him?"}
{"prompt": "What...?", "completion": "Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.", "completion": "All right.  Here."}
{"prompt": "Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.", "completion": "I don't want to hear that word!"}
{"prompt": "Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.", "completion": "We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes..."}
{"prompt": "You're sure?", "completion": "I'm sure."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to live anymore.", "completion": "Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance."}
{"prompt": "Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?", "completion": "Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people."}
{"prompt": "Poached!  Not over!  Over!", "completion": "Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it."}
{"prompt": "That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.", "completion": "All right, Captain Oveur.  Over."}
{"prompt": "Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.", "completion": "Just poached on toast.  Over."}
{"prompt": "How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.", "completion": "No.  Poached.  Over."}
{"prompt": "Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.", "completion": "A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over."}
{"prompt": "No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.", "completion": "What should I say?"}
{"prompt": "He's carrying a bomb.", "completion": "A b..."}
{"prompt": "Which passenger is Joe Salucci?", "completion": "Sixteen 'C', why?"}
{"prompt": "Whenever your're ready, Captain.", "completion": "Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down."}
{"prompt": "Good to be aboard, gentlemen.", "completion": "Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn."}
{"prompt": "That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.", "completion": "Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Kurtz, I presume.", "completion": "We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything."}
{"prompt": "Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.", "completion": "Captain Oveur?"}
{"prompt": "Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.", "completion": "Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.", "completion": "Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?"}
{"prompt": "But that's not a door.  The door's over there.", "completion": "You folks need any help?"}
{"prompt": "You can't go in there!", "completion": "Don't try to stop me!"}
{"prompt": "All right, it's a matter of death.", "completion": "Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock."}
{"prompt": "No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.", "completion": "You'll have to be more specific than that, sir."}
{"prompt": "I have to see Bud Kruger.", "completion": "Do you have an appointment, sir?"}
{"prompt": "Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!", "completion": "Pull yourself together!  We've got to..."}
{"prompt": "That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.", "completion": "Then Elaine was right."}
{"prompt": "Striker.", "completion": "Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?"}
{"prompt": "You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.", "completion": "I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown."}
{"prompt": "You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.", "completion": "Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures."}
{"prompt": "Are you on the Mercury mission?", "completion": "That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return."}
{"prompt": "No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.", "completion": "Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time."}
{"prompt": "Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.", "completion": "I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time."}
{"prompt": "Not if the people change together in relation to that love.", "completion": "Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged."}
{"prompt": "Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.", "completion": "People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own."}
{"prompt": "No.  I mean your relationship.", "completion": "We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to talk about it.", "completion": "I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.", "completion": "No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse."}
{"prompt": "You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.", "completion": "You've been hurt."}
{"prompt": "Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.", "completion": "I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go."}
{"prompt": "You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.", "completion": "Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?", "completion": "Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing."}
{"prompt": "Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.", "completion": "That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?", "completion": "No. I'm all alone."}
{"prompt": "Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.", "completion": "That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'"}
{"prompt": "I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.", "completion": "You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.", "completion": "I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage."}
{"prompt": "Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.", "completion": "But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?"}
{"prompt": "No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.", "completion": "After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business."}
{"prompt": "Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?", "completion": "Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you. Cream?", "completion": "No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men."}
{"prompt": "That's very nice of you. Thank you.", "completion": "Ah, won't you sit down?"}
{"prompt": "Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.", "completion": "I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee."}
{"prompt": "Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.", "completion": "...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it."}
{"prompt": "Something about a plane with no pilot?", "completion": "Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much."}
{"prompt": "Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.", "completion": "Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer."}
{"prompt": "Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.", "completion": "Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out."}
{"prompt": "And the last thing he said to me, \"Doc,\" he said, \"Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,\" he said, \"but I won't smell too good. That's for sure.\"", "completion": "Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land."}
{"prompt": "I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!", "completion": "George Zipp said that?"}
{"prompt": "I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.", "completion": "Surely there must be something you can do."}
{"prompt": "Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?", "completion": "Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?"}
{"prompt": "...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.", "completion": "Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?"}
{"prompt": "Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.", "completion": "Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights."}
{"prompt": "I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?", "completion": "Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!"}
{"prompt": "Can you fly this airplane and land it?", "completion": "Surely you can't be serious."}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.", "completion": "Both pilots!"}
{"prompt": "No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!", "completion": "What is it, Doctor? What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "Well...not for another two hours.", "completion": "You can't take a guess for another two hours?"}
{"prompt": "I can't tell.", "completion": "Can't you take a guess?"}
{"prompt": "I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.", "completion": "Captain, how soon can we land?"}
{"prompt": "Well...", "completion": "No. No one that I know of."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?"}
{"prompt": "Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.", "completion": "Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?"}
{"prompt": "He had fish, too.", "completion": "Just how serious is it, doctor?"}
{"prompt": "Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.", "completion": "Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?"}
{"prompt": "What did he have?", "completion": "He had fish."}
{"prompt": "Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.", "completion": "Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna."}
{"prompt": "Certainly.", "completion": "What was it we had for dinner tonight?"}
{"prompt": "A hospital? What is it?", "completion": "It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Yes, of course.", "completion": "You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?"}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.", "completion": "Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?"}
{"prompt": "The gear is down.", "completion": "See them, Elaine?"}
{"prompt": "I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.", "completion": "Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land."}
{"prompt": "Ted...", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "But Ted, you're the only...", "completion": "I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before."}
{"prompt": "What happened, Ted? What went wrong?", "completion": "Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan."}
{"prompt": "It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.", "completion": "Rats! I've lost number three."}
{"prompt": "Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.", "completion": "It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts."}
{"prompt": "And a little ice!", "completion": "Sluggish. Like a wet sponge."}
{"prompt": "Rain.", "completion": "And a little ice."}
{"prompt": "Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!", "completion": "That's what I've been trying to tell these people."}
{"prompt": "Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.", "completion": "A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp."}
{"prompt": "That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.", "completion": "I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!"}
{"prompt": "Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.", "completion": "What's his problem?"}
{"prompt": "Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?", "completion": "I wish I could say the same for George Zipp."}
{"prompt": "It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?", "completion": "Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid."}
{"prompt": "You got a telegram from head\ufffdquarters today.", "completion": "Headquarters!? What is it?"}
{"prompt": "That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.", "completion": "But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!"}
{"prompt": "I remember everything. All I have are memories.", "completion": "Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us."}
{"prompt": "I love you.", "completion": "Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.", "completion": "I love you, Elaine."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter?", "completion": "My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission."}
{"prompt": "Elaine, I've got to talk to you.", "completion": "You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now."}
{"prompt": "It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.", "completion": "Ted, what are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.", "completion": "But if you'll just give me..."}
{"prompt": "Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.", "completion": "You expect me to believe that?"}
{"prompt": "Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?", "completion": "You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record."}
{"prompt": "I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.", "completion": "Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change."}
{"prompt": "It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!", "completion": "Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over."}
{"prompt": "I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.", "completion": "Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?"}
{"prompt": "I just don't want to go over it any more.", "completion": "I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out."}
{"prompt": "Ted!", "completion": "I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.", "completion": "Elaine!"}
{"prompt": "Airsick?", "completion": "I think so, but I've never seen it so acute."}
{"prompt": "Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.", "completion": "Who wants to be first?"}
{"prompt": "We'd better get back now.", "completion": "Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to."}
{"prompt": "We have a visitor.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.", "completion": "Good-bye, darling."}
{"prompt": "Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.", "completion": "Good-bye, darling."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.", "completion": "So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself."}
{"prompt": "Every day.", "completion": "Good-bye, darling."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.", "completion": "You promise you'll write."}
{"prompt": "He's right on the heading.", "completion": "All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner."}
{"prompt": "He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!", "completion": "Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather."}
{"prompt": "Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.", "completion": "You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet."}
{"prompt": "Did you decide on a runway yet?", "completion": "Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind."}
{"prompt": "And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?", "completion": "Yes, Captain?"}
{"prompt": "Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.", "completion": "Here."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "How ya doing, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.", "completion": "Oh, I can't stand it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!", "completion": "What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'"}
{"prompt": "The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.", "completion": "Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago."}
{"prompt": "We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.", "completion": "...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs."}
{"prompt": "Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.", "completion": "...and that lots of times you don't even run down court."}
{"prompt": "I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.", "completion": "I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense."}
{"prompt": "You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!", "completion": "I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!", "completion": "I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'd love to.", "completion": "Okay, this is one of my favorites."}
{"prompt": "I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!", "completion": "I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song."}
{"prompt": "Hi!", "completion": "I'm Randy."}
{"prompt": "Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?", "completion": "Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?", "completion": "Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?"}
{"prompt": "I will, but Jim won't.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.", "completion": "Would either of you like another cup of coffee?"}
{"prompt": "No, why don't you take care ot it?", "completion": "No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here."}
{"prompt": "Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?", "completion": "Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?"}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "We have clearance, Clarence."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "Roger."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.", "completion": "Roger."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.", "completion": "Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "There's a little girl on board who's ill and..."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.", "completion": "Excuse me, Sister?"}
{"prompt": "Would you go up, please?", "completion": "Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready."}
{"prompt": "It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?", "completion": "Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...", "completion": "The cockpit? What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?", "completion": "No. No thank you."}
{"prompt": "Do you feel all right, sir?", "completion": "Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time."}
{"prompt": "Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "You okay?", "completion": "Yeah..."}
{"prompt": "I like my horizons narrow.", "completion": "Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes."}
{"prompt": "There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.", "completion": "I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons."}
{"prompt": "Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.", "completion": "A virgin.  I find that very arousing..."}
{"prompt": "Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.", "completion": "I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?"}
{"prompt": "Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.", "completion": "The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows."}
{"prompt": "Does that cost extra or you throw them in?", "completion": "You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable..."}
{"prompt": "Show me.", "completion": "Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes."}
{"prompt": "She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.", "completion": "In there."}
{"prompt": "He's not here.  Why ask me?", "completion": "The young woman at the front said you might know where he is."}
{"prompt": "We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--", "completion": "Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect."}
{"prompt": "You are Cassandra?", "completion": "That's right."}
{"prompt": "Lay off, asshole.", "completion": "I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.", "completion": "Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?"}
{"prompt": "You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...", "completion": "Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!"}
{"prompt": "Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?", "completion": "You don't have squat."}
{"prompt": "No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...", "completion": "So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?"}
{"prompt": "That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.", "completion": "Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history..."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.", "completion": "You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing."}
{"prompt": "I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.", "completion": "Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet."}
{"prompt": "William Harcourt?", "completion": "Yes..."}
{"prompt": "Here?", "completion": "Do it!"}
{"prompt": "This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.", "completion": "Kill them both."}
{"prompt": "It is his new partner that I'm worried about.", "completion": "When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley."}
{"prompt": "This is becoming a serious breach of security.", "completion": "He didn't recognize me."}
{"prompt": "You look very good.", "completion": "That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver."}
{"prompt": "You understand that.  But how many others will?", "completion": "How do I look?"}
{"prompt": "Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.", "completion": "But there's no more drug."}
{"prompt": "We can't let him get away.", "completion": "Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me about it...", "completion": "I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up."}
{"prompt": "Harcourt is dead.", "completion": "No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're..."}
{"prompt": "What is this?!", "completion": "... It's Harcourt."}
{"prompt": "No!  We must do this alone.", "completion": "Do what?!  George-- ?!"}
{"prompt": "What's this about, George?  I know that look.", "completion": "There!  Go back.  Down that side street."}
{"prompt": "With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.", "completion": "It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective."}
{"prompt": "Shit!", "completion": "Ss-ai!"}
{"prompt": NaN, "completion": "Fuck procedure."}
{"prompt": "The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.", "completion": "Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?"}
{"prompt": "Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.", "completion": "George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit."}
{"prompt": "Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?", "completion": "George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones..."}
{"prompt": "No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?", "completion": "Uh, George..."}
{"prompt": "Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.", "completion": "If the drug is here, we must destroy it."}
{"prompt": "They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--", "completion": "Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together."}
{"prompt": "George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.", "completion": "I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you."}
{"prompt": "Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?", "completion": "Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here."}
{"prompt": "Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?", "completion": "No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded."}
{"prompt": "We?  You've taken it?", "completion": "We all did."}
{"prompt": "How potent?", "completion": "Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The \"high\" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."}
{"prompt": "The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?", "completion": "... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic."}
{"prompt": "No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!", "completion": "No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern."}
{"prompt": "What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.", "completion": "You must leave me alone on this."}
{"prompt": "Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...", "completion": "... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "What was that about?"}
{"prompt": "Stop the car!", "completion": "It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes."}
{"prompt": "Please, I must get out here.", "completion": "Come on, you won't have to get near the water."}
{"prompt": "Stop the car.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "To the... to the beach?", "completion": "Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!"}
{"prompt": "She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.", "completion": "Well, let's roll, George."}
{"prompt": "She's going to divorce me.", "completion": "George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?"}
{"prompt": "Where'd you get this?!!", "completion": "A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife..."}
{"prompt": "I'm going home.", "completion": "Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.", "completion": "Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals."}
{"prompt": "No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.", "completion": "You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here."}
{"prompt": "Ta ss'trakyona'...", "completion": "There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other."}
{"prompt": "Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?", "completion": "Your health..."}
{"prompt": "... and so, and so the doctor says, \"If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?\"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?", "completion": "In the other man's rectum."}
{"prompt": "Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...", "completion": "Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there..."}
{"prompt": "Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.", "completion": "I appreciate your honesty, George."}
{"prompt": "We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.", "completion": "It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place."}
{"prompt": "You are married?", "completion": "Was.  Divorced."}
{"prompt": "My wife?  She worries about me.", "completion": "Yeah... I know the routine."}
{"prompt": "Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.", "completion": "So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?"}
{"prompt": "When will Strader return?", "completion": "I believe he is probably lying."}
{"prompt": "Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.", "completion": "We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.", "completion": "Who is he?"}
{"prompt": "And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.", "completion": "Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'."}
{"prompt": "So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?", "completion": "Ss'loka'.  It means literally \"small but intelligent creature\".  It loses much in the translation."}
{"prompt": "I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?", "completion": "Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked."}
{"prompt": "Which one is that?  Raw what?", "completion": "This is mole.  It's good."}
{"prompt": "I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?", "completion": "Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments."}
{"prompt": "If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.", "completion": "Yeah, sure.  I knew that..."}
{"prompt": "How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?", "completion": "In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families..."}
{"prompt": "You know that guy?", "completion": "From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together."}
{"prompt": "Matthew, you don't have to-- .", "completion": "Stay back!  I'm okay."}
{"prompt": "Your mother mates out of season.", "completion": "That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?"}
{"prompt": "Screw me?  That can't be right.", "completion": "Tell me."}
{"prompt": "I'll handle it.", "completion": "Screw you."}
{"prompt": "Back off, George.", "completion": "But I-- ."}
{"prompt": "Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?", "completion": "Uh, Matthew..."}
{"prompt": "Who said that?", "completion": "At the end of the bar."}
{"prompt": "Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...", "completion": "My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing..."}
{"prompt": "Why did you do it?", "completion": "Why'd I do what?"}
{"prompt": "Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...", "completion": "We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley."}
{"prompt": "Did you talk to him?", "completion": "He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him."}
{"prompt": "Aw-right.  What about the other guy?", "completion": "She didn't know him.  But she said her son might."}
{"prompt": "Did you learn anything?", "completion": "A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley."}
{"prompt": "Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.", "completion": "Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well."}
{"prompt": "So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that \"possible\" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.", "completion": "I believe I should interview the widow alone."}
{"prompt": "How the hell do you know that?", "completion": "A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one."}
{"prompt": "And still it fits?", "completion": "Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks."}
{"prompt": "And that fits?", "completion": "Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches."}
{"prompt": "A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?", "completion": "Get the picture?"}
{"prompt": "Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "Nothing?"}
{"prompt": "Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?", "completion": "What's this?  What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?", "completion": "Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--"}
{"prompt": "Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?", "completion": "Well... yes, quite possibly."}
{"prompt": "Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.", "completion": "What is wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...", "completion": "The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--"}
{"prompt": "Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?", "completion": "There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings."}
{"prompt": "Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.", "completion": "Nice signal, dickwad!"}
{"prompt": "His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.", "completion": "With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest."}
{"prompt": "That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like \"ss'ai k'ss\", two words in my language which mean \"excrement\" and \"cranium\".", "completion": "Let's talk Hubley."}
{"prompt": "Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?", "completion": "Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?"}
{"prompt": "Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?", "completion": "My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'."}
{"prompt": "What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.", "completion": "I am George."}
{"prompt": "... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.", "completion": "Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.", "completion": "No... two."}
{"prompt": "Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.", "completion": "Only holds five."}
{"prompt": "You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.", "completion": "... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon."}
{"prompt": "That where Anderson worked?", "completion": "Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it."}
{"prompt": "Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.", "completion": "I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off."}
{"prompt": "To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.", "completion": "Who else can I ask around here?"}
{"prompt": "You think this is the guy who did it?", "completion": "We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.", "completion": "Well, one of the men didn't like him so much..."}
{"prompt": "Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?", "completion": "Sure.  Just a minute."}
{"prompt": "Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.", "completion": "I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up..."}
{"prompt": "For you, anything.", "completion": "Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son."}
{"prompt": "Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.", "completion": "Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I heard of it.", "completion": "That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else."}
{"prompt": "One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?", "completion": "Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters."}
{"prompt": "Ss'kya'ta'.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Did he find anything?", "completion": "Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?"}
{"prompt": "What kind of test?", "completion": "Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day."}
{"prompt": "You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?", "completion": "You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now."}
{"prompt": "Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.", "completion": "Yeah, I'll bet."}
{"prompt": "Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.", "completion": "That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts."}
{"prompt": "Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.", "completion": "You took this gut out, too, didn't you?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.", "completion": "No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--", "completion": "The human?"}
{"prompt": "You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...", "completion": "Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours."}
{"prompt": "Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...", "completion": "Don't tell me what to think."}
{"prompt": "You?", "completion": "Granger and Pitts are already on it."}
{"prompt": "You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.", "completion": "Departmental policy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Sykes?", "completion": "Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective."}
{"prompt": "I can't!  Do you mind!", "completion": "I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!"}
{"prompt": "I got him.  Don't get pinned.", "completion": "Get outta there!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.", "completion": "Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door."}
{"prompt": "You got your vest?", "completion": "Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car."}
{"prompt": "Does that look at all suspicious to you?", "completion": "Whatever gave you that idea?"}
{"prompt": "But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.", "completion": "Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers."}
{"prompt": "Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...", "completion": "Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--"}
{"prompt": "Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "It is.", "completion": "How can I go?"}
{"prompt": "Uh, seems to be in front and behind.", "completion": "Hope their plumbing's the same."}
{"prompt": "Can't lock up...", "completion": "Talk to me, Hudson."}
{"prompt": "Movement!", "completion": "Position?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?", "completion": "Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity."}
{"prompt": "Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.", "completion": "Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!"}
{"prompt": "Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?", "completion": "Would you, Sir?"}
{"prompt": "Say again?  All after incinerators?", "completion": "This floor's freezing."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.  Pull 'em out.", "completion": "Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over."}
{"prompt": "Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.", "completion": "Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung."}
{"prompt": "Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!", "completion": "First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear."}
{"prompt": "Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.", "completion": "Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station."}
{"prompt": "Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.", "completion": "Okay, let's do it."}
{"prompt": "Well, thanks, I --", "completion": "...that's better.  Pan it around a bit."}
{"prompt": "In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.", "completion": "You did okay, Bishop."}
{"prompt": "Ripley...", "completion": "She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it."}
{"prompt": "PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!", "completion": "WE'RE NOT LEAVING!"}
{"prompt": "See you soon.", "completion": "HOW MUCH TIME?"}
{"prompt": "All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?", "completion": "It's going to be closer.  You better get going."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.", "completion": "I'll go."}
{"prompt": "I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.", "completion": "And it's too late to shut it down?"}
{"prompt": "That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.", "completion": "How long until it blows?"}
{"prompt": "Could it be intelligent?", "completion": "Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course."}
{"prompt": "You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?", "completion": "Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society."}
{"prompt": "But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.", "completion": "That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs."}
{"prompt": "Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.", "completion": "Yes.  That follows."}
{"prompt": "I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.", "completion": "Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those..."}
{"prompt": "I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.", "completion": "Sorry to disappoint you."}
{"prompt": "You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?", "completion": "Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing."}
{"prompt": "Now, wait a second --", "completion": "You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J."}
{"prompt": "You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.", "completion": "But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --"}
{"prompt": "Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.", "completion": "You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code."}
{"prompt": "Corporal Hicks!?", "completion": "This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?"}
{"prompt": "Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.", "completion": "What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit!", "completion": "You son of a bitch."}
{"prompt": "They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?", "completion": "This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --"}

{"prompt": "You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.", "completion": "They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case."}

{"prompt": "They're in the approach corridor.", "completion": "On my way."}
{"prompt": "We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.", "completion": "That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here."}
{"prompt": "About seventeen days.", "completion": "All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door."}

{"prompt": "It's inside the complex.", "completion": "You're just reading me."}
{"prompt": "Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!", "completion": "Hudson, give us a break."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.", "completion": "Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!"}
{"prompt": "All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?", "completion": "Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?"}

{"prompt": "No.  Have you?", "completion": "Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up."}

{"prompt": "They cut the power.", "completion": "What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals."}
{"prompt": "Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.", "completion": "Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way."}
{"prompt": "Think of what?  We're fucked.", "completion": "What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?"}
{"prompt": "How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.", "completion": "I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something."}
{"prompt": "Uh, what's next?", "completion": "We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow."}

I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'", "completion": "So what do I tell this guy?"}

{"prompt": "Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.", "completion": "Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Stanzi.", "completion": "I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common."}
{"prompt": "Why not? Half the house!", "completion": "When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it."}
{"prompt": "I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?", "completion": "You're not going to do this?"}
{"prompt": "Your father is dead.", "completion": "Half the receipts! Stanzi!"}
{"prompt": "Wolfi! Your father is dead.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "These gentlemen are from Salzburg.", "completion": "Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!"}
{"prompt": "Wolfi.", "completion": "Yes, my love?"}
{"prompt": "No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?", "completion": "We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl."}
{"prompt": "Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -", "completion": "Stanzi!"}
{"prompt": "She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.", "completion": "Oh, damn!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Well, ask her!"}
{"prompt": "There's a young girl to see you.", "completion": "What does she want?"}
{"prompt": "What? How can you be so boring? Tea!", "completion": "Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here."}
{"prompt": "Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?", "completion": "Wolfi!"}
{"prompt": "He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.", "completion": "May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?"}
{"prompt": "My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?", "completion": "Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart."}
{"prompt": "Yes!", "completion": "I love you! I love you!"}
{"prompt": "Sssh. What is it? Tell me.", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with you?", "completion": "Tell them to go!"}
{"prompt": "Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.", "completion": "Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody."}
{"prompt": "Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.", "completion": "This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!"}
{"prompt": "Don't be stupid.", "completion": "All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?"}
{"prompt": "Well, don't do that again!", "completion": "How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?"}
{"prompt": "You borrowed money from your mother?", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes? You always know everything.", "completion": "Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!"}
{"prompt": "They'll come anyway. They love me here.", "completion": "No, they will not. I know how things work in this city."}
{"prompt": "Oh, leave me alone.", "completion": "One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!"}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "I think you're mad! You're really mad!"}
{"prompt": "Eat my - ah!", "completion": "Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?"}
{"prompt": "Eat", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Tish-I'm-tee."}
{"prompt": "Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!", "completion": "Tish-I'm tee. What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.", "completion": "Ui-vol-i-tub!"}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm not playing this game.", "completion": "No, this is serious. Say it backwards."}
{"prompt": "Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!", "completion": "Em iram! Em iram!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, you are. You're very sick.", "completion": "No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, ha, ha, ha.", "completion": "Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!"}
{"prompt": "Do you think that's funny?", "completion": "Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years."}
{"prompt": "That's stupid.", "completion": "Why? People fart backwards."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards."}
{"prompt": "Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.", "completion": "Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway."}
{"prompt": "We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.", "completion": "Fartsbishop!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.", "completion": "No! No! No!"}
{"prompt": "Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.", "completion": "Stop it!"}
{"prompt": "He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.", "completion": "I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go."}
{"prompt": "This is not his handwriting.", "completion": "No. I was assisting him. He asked me."}
{"prompt": "He asked me to stay.", "completion": "And I'm asking you -"}
{"prompt": "He needs me, ma'am.", "completion": "No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please."}
{"prompt": "I was at hand.", "completion": "Well, thank you very much. You can go now."}
{"prompt": "Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.", "completion": "Why you?"}
{"prompt": "Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "But! I'm a married woman!", "completion": "Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price."}
{"prompt": "Isn't it obvious?", "completion": "It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight."}
{"prompt": "Some service deserves service in return. No?", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "Alone.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "Come back tonight.", "completion": "Tonight?"}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.", "completion": "Oh, thank you, sir!"}
{"prompt": "It is miraculous.", "completion": "Oh yes. He's really proud of his work."}
{"prompt": "These are originals?", "completion": "Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies."}
{"prompt": "Originals?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.", "completion": "That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much, Your Excellency.", "completion": "Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband."}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!"}
{"prompt": "Then he didn't send you?", "completion": "No, sir. This is my own idea."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.", "completion": "I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here."}
{"prompt": "I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.", "completion": "Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait."}
{"prompt": "He's terribly busy, sir.", "completion": "I understand."}
{"prompt": "That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.", "completion": "How charming.  But why did he not come himself?"}
{"prompt": "Madame. How can I help you?", "completion": "Frau Mozart?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?", "completion": "Excellency!"}
{"prompt": "Money! Money!", "completion": "You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi."}
{"prompt": "You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!", "completion": "Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?"}
{"prompt": "He's doing his best.", "completion": "I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!"}
{"prompt": "Leave him alone!", "completion": "I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?"}
{"prompt": "I hope so. I need it immediately.", "completion": "Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?"}
{"prompt": "Where's our friend?", "completion": "He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you."}
{"prompt": "Am I interrupting something?", "completion": "Not at all."}
{"prompt": "How much will you pay him?", "completion": "Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?"}
{"prompt": "So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.", "completion": "Do you hear him? Do you?"}
{"prompt": "And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?", "completion": "Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!"}
{"prompt": "Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?", "completion": "And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat."}
{"prompt": "What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.", "completion": "But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!"}
{"prompt": "When, may I ask?", "completion": "In three months! Papa."}
{"prompt": "I see that you're expecting.", "completion": "Oh, yes."}
{"prompt": "Behold!", "completion": "Behold!"}
{"prompt": "Hey!", "completion": "Hey!"}
{"prompt": "Behold!", "completion": "Behold!"}
{"prompt": "He's adorable!", "completion": "Adorable!"}
{"prompt": "Be careful!", "completion": "Be careful!"}
{"prompt": "I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.", "completion": "Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!"}
{"prompt": "I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.", "completion": "Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!"}
{"prompt": "I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.", "completion": "Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!"}
{"prompt": "Yes. He is a little strange.", "completion": "Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor."}
{"prompt": "Michael!", "completion": "What a strange young man."}
{"prompt": "Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.", "completion": "I said play!"}
{"prompt": "It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.", "completion": "People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so."}
{"prompt": "I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.", "completion": "Gertrude!"}
{"prompt": "Gertrude!", "completion": "You can't be Herr Mozart!"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.", "completion": "Upstairs."}
{"prompt": "Who was your teacher?", "completion": "I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her."}
{"prompt": "Wine?", "completion": "Just one year."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?", "completion": "I'd like a little wine, if you have it."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Ah, now! Here she comes."}
{"prompt": "It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.", "completion": "Well, look at them."}
{"prompt": "Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.", "completion": "Do you like this, Salieri?"}
{"prompt": "As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.", "completion": "Of course not."}
{"prompt": "Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.", "completion": "Oh?"}
{"prompt": "Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Well. There it is.", "completion": "I don't think you understand me, Court Composer."}
{"prompt": "You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.", "completion": "Sire."}
{"prompt": "Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.", "completion": "I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes."}
{"prompt": "And the result satisfies.", "completion": "Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "You already commissioned an opera from Mozart."}
{"prompt": "I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?", "completion": "An interesting idea, Majesty. But -"}
{"prompt": "Your Highness.", "completion": "Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!"}
{"prompt": "Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.", "completion": "Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm glad to hear that.", "completion": "Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn."}
{"prompt": "My pleasure.", "completion": "Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.", "completion": "Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!"}
{"prompt": "A-flat, Majesty.", "completion": "Ah-ha!"}
{"prompt": "You do me too much honour, Sire.", "completion": "Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice."}
{"prompt": "Majesty.", "completion": "Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?"}
{"prompt": "It's just a trifle, of course.", "completion": "May I try it?"}
{"prompt": "You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.", "completion": "What a charming idea. May I see?"}
{"prompt": "Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?", "completion": "I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention."}
{"prompt": "Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.", "completion": "You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade."}
{"prompt": "Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!", "completion": "Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives."}
{"prompt": "I have no idea.", "completion": "Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it."}
{"prompt": "Ah, love again.", "completion": "But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?"}
{"prompt": "I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.", "completion": "But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love."}
{"prompt": "Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.", "completion": "Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics."}
{"prompt": "Would you tell me why?", "completion": "Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy."}
{"prompt": "It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?", "completion": "Well, yes, I admit it is."}
{"prompt": "Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?", "completion": "Who told you this, Majesty?"}
{"prompt": "Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?", "completion": "Yes, Sire."}
{"prompt": "May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.", "completion": "Ah! By all means."}
{"prompt": "Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.", "completion": "Thank you, Sire!"}
{"prompt": "Twenty-six.", "completion": "Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna."}
{"prompt": "Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.", "completion": "Excuse me, but how old are you?"}
{"prompt": "Enchanted, Madame.", "completion": "Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?"}
{"prompt": "Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?", "completion": "Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady."}
{"prompt": "My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?", "completion": "My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect."}
{"prompt": "Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?", "completion": "I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less."}
{"prompt": "Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.", "completion": "What do you mean, Sire?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!", "completion": "So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, indeed.", "completion": "And German?"}
{"prompt": "I think so, Sire, yes.", "completion": "It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?"}
{"prompt": "Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.", "completion": "What? On one hearing only?"}
{"prompt": "In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.", "completion": "Ah-ha."}
{"prompt": "It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -", "completion": "Yes, where?"}
{"prompt": "Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!", "completion": "Well, what is it about? Tell us the story."}
{"prompt": "Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?", "completion": "Why so?"}
{"prompt": "Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!", "completion": "Majesty!"}
{"prompt": "Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.", "completion": "And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you."}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank you.", "completion": "The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg."}
{"prompt": "Your Majesty!", "completion": "No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?"}
{"prompt": "He's here.", "completion": "Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good."}
{"prompt": "Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -", "completion": "Yes, what about him?"}
{"prompt": "Well. There it is.", "completion": "Well, what do you have for me today?"}
{"prompt": "In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.", "completion": "Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?"}
{"prompt": "Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?", "completion": "I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop."}
{"prompt": "Father -", "completion": "Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'"}
{"prompt": "No one calls you that.", "completion": "She does. She says I sleep all day."}
{"prompt": "Papa!", "completion": "Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden."}
{"prompt": "I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?", "completion": "Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!"}
{"prompt": "Mine?", "completion": "Are you playing a trick on me?"}
{"prompt": "But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.", "completion": "Papa, is this your idea?"}
{"prompt": "I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.", "completion": "I'm tired of this game. Please play without me."}
{"prompt": "This is just a game, Papa.", "completion": "Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!"}
{"prompt": "Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!", "completion": "No, really!"}
{"prompt": "Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.", "completion": "Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me."}
{"prompt": "Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.", "completion": "Why didn't you mention it in your letters?"}
{"prompt": "You don't have secrets from me.", "completion": "It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!"}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "It's a secret."}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "Oh, let's not talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Composition doesn't pay. You know that.", "completion": "This one will."}
{"prompt": "How many?", "completion": "I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "How many pupils do you have?", "completion": "Pupils?"}
{"prompt": "They say you're in debt.", "completion": "Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!"}
{"prompt": "That's not what I hear.", "completion": "What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here."}
{"prompt": "How is your financial situation?", "completion": "It couldn't be better."}
{"prompt": "Don't you have a maid?", "completion": "Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.", "completion": "She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!", "completion": "Do you always live like this?"}
{"prompt": "Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.", "completion": "Is she not here?"}
{"prompt": "Am I not welcome?", "completion": "Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!"}
{"prompt": "I will.", "completion": "Why are you here?"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure it's an opera?", "completion": "I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming."}
{"prompt": "Opera? Opera!", "completion": "Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened."}
{"prompt": "Is he working?", "completion": "I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera."}
{"prompt": "Is he working?", "completion": "I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over."}
{"prompt": "What medicine?", "completion": "I don't know. He has pains."}
{"prompt": "Why? What has happened?", "completion": "You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse."}
{"prompt": "Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?", "completion": "I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!"}
{"prompt": "Where does he work?", "completion": "In there, sir."}
{"prompt": "I think I've found out about the money, sir.", "completion": "Yes what?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.", "completion": "Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.", "completion": "Really? What is it he's writing?"}
{"prompt": "Not that I've seen.", "completion": "Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank you, sir.", "completion": "Do any pupils come to the house?"}
{"prompt": "Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.", "completion": "Bene."}
{"prompt": "Yes, thank you, sir.", "completion": "Bene! Bene!"}
{"prompt": "I will, sir.", "completion": "Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?"}
{"prompt": "What have you got for me today? Let me see.", "completion": "Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker."}
{"prompt": "Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.", "completion": "Good morning, sir."}
{"prompt": "Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?", "completion": "Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Are you Herr Mozart?"}
{"prompt": "Well, we can.", "completion": "So let me see it. Where is it?"}
{"prompt": "Because there's nothing to see.", "completion": "Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Can I see it?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?"}
{"prompt": "Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.", "completion": "Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?"}
{"prompt": "Put it down!", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "Leave that alone!", "completion": "Wolfi!"}
{"prompt": "No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.", "completion": "So there you are. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "German!", "completion": "Of course! What else do you think they speak here?"}
{"prompt": "I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.", "completion": "I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German."}
{"prompt": "'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.", "completion": "Animals?"}
{"prompt": "Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.", "completion": "I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it."}
{"prompt": "Yes, well, it's all good fun.", "completion": "I liked the horse."}
{"prompt": "That kind of music should be punishable by death.", "completion": "Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?"}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "Sublime! Utterly sublime!"}
{"prompt": "What did he say? What did he say?", "completion": "Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room."}
{"prompt": "Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!", "completion": "Sssh! Stay here."}
{"prompt": "My answer is no, Mozart.", "completion": "Sssh!"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. No.", "completion": "Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir."}
{"prompt": "Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.", "completion": "No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours."}
{"prompt": "What for?", "completion": "If a man cannot earn, he must borrow."}
{"prompt": "What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?", "completion": "Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?"}
{"prompt": "Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.", "completion": "Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?"}
{"prompt": "Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?", "completion": "Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?"}
{"prompt": "It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!", "completion": "Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!"}
{"prompt": "Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?", "completion": "Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?"}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.", "completion": "Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid I am.", "completion": "Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?"}
{"prompt": "Madame.", "completion": "This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?"}
{"prompt": "What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.", "completion": "You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife."}
{"prompt": "Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.", "completion": "And which one of them do you want me to teach?"}
{"prompt": "What for?", "completion": "I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!"}
{"prompt": "I'm not leaving you.", "completion": "I am so ashamed."}
{"prompt": "I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?", "completion": "Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no. I'm not tired at all.", "completion": "We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa."}
{"prompt": "Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!", "completion": "Do you want to rest a bit?"}
{"prompt": "Do you have it?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "And that's it. Do you have it?", "completion": "You go fast!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, and on 'dictis'.", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.", "completion": "Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?"}
{"prompt": "That's wonderful!", "completion": "Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed."}
{"prompt": "I think so.", "completion": "Show me."}
{"prompt": "Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.", "completion": "Do you have me?"}
{"prompt": "Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.", "completion": "And that's all?"}
{"prompt": "With the tenors.", "completion": "Also identical?"}
{"prompt": "It couldn't be simpler.", "completion": "First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?"}
{"prompt": "Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -", "completion": "Please! Just one moment."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis."}
{"prompt": "Sing it back.", "completion": "Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?"}
{"prompt": "Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?", "completion": "I think so."}
{"prompt": "Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What time?", "completion": "Common time."}
{"prompt": "So now - A minor. Suddenly.", "completion": "The Fire."}
{"prompt": "We ended in F Major?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Come. Let's begin.", "completion": "Confutatis Maledictis."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes.", "completion": "Strange!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?"}
{"prompt": "Consigned to flames of woe.", "completion": "Do you believe in it?"}
{"prompt": "The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.", "completion": "So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?"}
{"prompt": "A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.", "completion": "Where did I stop?"}
{"prompt": "You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.", "completion": "Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?"}
{"prompt": "But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Would you? Actually, you could.", "completion": "My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?", "completion": "Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?"}
{"prompt": "Finish what?", "completion": "He knows. He knows!"}
{"prompt": "What man?", "completion": "Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "The man. He's here."}
{"prompt": "Shall I answer it?", "completion": "No! No, it's him!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'm too young to be so sick."}
{"prompt": "Are you ill?", "completion": "The doctor thinks I am. But -"}
{"prompt": "I do.", "completion": "I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things."}
{"prompt": "Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.", "completion": "Do you mean that?"}
{"prompt": "I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.", "completion": "This is only a vaudeville."}
{"prompt": "No, please.", "completion": "I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did."}
{"prompt": "You mean she's not coming back?", "completion": "You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Where is your wife?", "completion": "Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa."}
{"prompt": "I'm taking you home. You're not well.", "completion": "No, no. I have to get back. I have -"}
{"prompt": "No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!", "completion": "What happened? Is it over?"}
{"prompt": "I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.", "completion": "Are you neglecting my request?"}
{"prompt": "How long will you give me?", "completion": "Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon."}
{"prompt": "I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.", "completion": "How much?"}
{"prompt": "A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "A Mass for the dead.", "completion": "What dead? Who is dead?"}
{"prompt": "I have come to commission work from you.", "completion": "What work?"}
{"prompt": "You flatter me.", "completion": "Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "I never knew that music like that was possible."}
{"prompt": "Did my work please you?", "completion": "How could it not, Excellency?"}
{"prompt": "Mozart. It was good of you to come.", "completion": "How could I not?"}
{"prompt": "Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!", "completion": "Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!"}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.", "completion": "Oh no, the honour would be all mine."}
{"prompt": "I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?", "completion": "I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that."}
{"prompt": "I think it's marvelous. Truly.", "completion": "It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.", "completion": "What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?"}
{"prompt": "I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.", "completion": "But what is it they don't like?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you! Oh, thank you.", "completion": "Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Excellency, would you?", "completion": "With all my heart, Mozart."}
{"prompt": "It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.", "completion": "But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor."}
{"prompt": "Oh no! My wife took it out in time.", "completion": "How fortunate."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!", "completion": "You burned the score?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?", "completion": "Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours."}
{"prompt": "It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.", "completion": "Really? Why?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?", "completion": "Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "What exactly are you working on?", "completion": "I can't say. Really"}
{"prompt": "Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.", "completion": "Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?"}
{"prompt": "Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.", "completion": "Ah. Italian?"}
{"prompt": "Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.", "completion": "Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.", "completion": "I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid not.", "completion": "Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!"}
{"prompt": "Of course not.", "completion": "Do you have a daughter?"}
{"prompt": "How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.", "completion": "They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!"}
{"prompt": "It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.", "completion": "How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!"}
{"prompt": "You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?", "completion": "No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why."}
{"prompt": "An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.", "completion": "Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage."}
{"prompt": "No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.", "completion": "But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!"}
{"prompt": "Herr Sommer.", "completion": "Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity."}
{"prompt": "My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.", "completion": "Whom did they choose?"}
{"prompt": "I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.", "completion": "Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!"}
{"prompt": "Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.", "completion": "Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?"}
{"prompt": "I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.", "completion": "So you see, this post is very important to me right now."}
{"prompt": "So you are. How is your pretty wife?", "completion": "She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know."}
{"prompt": "Herr Mozart, what brings you here?", "completion": "Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now."}
{"prompt": "How could I not?", "completion": "It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?"}
{"prompt": "Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.", "completion": "Did you like it, then?"}
{"prompt": "Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.", "completion": "But this is absurd!"}
{"prompt": "Love, Sire!", "completion": "Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that."}
{"prompt": "Ah!", "completion": "A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Mio caro Adone."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!", "completion": "I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?"}
{"prompt": "Taking out what you should never have put in.", "completion": "Can we see the scene with the music back, please?"}
{"prompt": "It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.", "completion": "What are you doing, Herr Director?"}
{"prompt": "Exactly. A dance.", "completion": "But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story."}
{"prompt": "Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?", "completion": "Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding."}
{"prompt": "Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.", "completion": "Certainly, Herr Director."}
{"prompt": "That will do, Herr Mozart!", "completion": "Just let me tell you how it begins."}
{"prompt": "What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.", "completion": "But, Your Majesty -"}
{"prompt": "Then why especially does it have to be in German?", "completion": "Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care."}
{"prompt": "You mean in Turkey?", "completion": "Exactly."}
{"prompt": "I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.", "completion": "I think you'd better."}
{"prompt": "May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?", "completion": "Oh? Have I seen it?"}
{"prompt": "Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!", "completion": "Herr Mozart -"}
{"prompt": "Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!", "completion": "Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues."}
{"prompt": "They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.", "completion": "Mozart -"}
{"prompt": "Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!", "completion": "Mozart -"}
{"prompt": "Who is on this committee?", "completion": "Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri."}
{"prompt": "No, but I'm the best.", "completion": "A little modesty would suit you better."}
{"prompt": "Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?", "completion": "Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna."}
{"prompt": "Is the Emperor angry with me?", "completion": "On the contrary."}
{"prompt": "Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.", "completion": "Because His Majesty wishes it."}
{"prompt": "What is this, Herr Chamberlain?", "completion": "What is what?"}
{"prompt": "Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?", "completion": "Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty."}
{"prompt": "Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?", "completion": "Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?"}
{"prompt": "Baron!", "completion": "Mozart -"}
{"prompt": "Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!", "completion": "Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine."}
{"prompt": "Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.", "completion": "My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?"}
{"prompt": "Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.", "completion": "I don't think it was really decided, Director."}
{"prompt": "No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!", "completion": "Oh my son, my poor son!"}
{"prompt": "What difference does that make?", "completion": "My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?"}
{"prompt": "I poisoned his life.", "completion": "But not his body."}
{"prompt": "I did.", "completion": "No, you didn't!"}
{"prompt": "The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.", "completion": "Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him."}
{"prompt": "His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!", "completion": "I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should."}
{"prompt": "All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!", "completion": "My son, no one can speak for God."}
{"prompt": "No? Was Mozart a good man?", "completion": "God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.", "completion": "You cannot say that!"}
{"prompt": "Did you try?", "completion": "Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!"}
{"prompt": "He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.", "completion": "It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them."}
{"prompt": "Should I?", "completion": "Do you hear me?"}
{"prompt": "Is it true?", "completion": "Do you believe it?"}
{"prompt": "All Vienna has heard that.", "completion": "And do they believe it?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.", "completion": "Ah - you've heard that?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.", "completion": "I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?"}
{"prompt": "I regret it is not too familiar.", "completion": "Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?"}
{"prompt": "I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?", "completion": "Well?"}
{"prompt": "Then you must know this.", "completion": "I can't say I do. What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "Here in Vienna."}
{"prompt": "How well are you trained in music?", "completion": "I know a little. I studied it in my youth."}
{"prompt": "I do not seek forgiveness.", "completion": "My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me."}
{"prompt": "Are they?", "completion": "Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness."}
{"prompt": "Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?", "completion": "That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes."}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone.", "completion": "I cannot leave alone a soul in pain."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely."}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "In the sight of God that is a sin."}
{"prompt": "About what?", "completion": "You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone."}
{"prompt": "Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?", "completion": "Yes, in the third act."}
{"prompt": "Ballet? What ballet?", "completion": "Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?"}
{"prompt": "What anger?", "completion": "About the ballet."}
{"prompt": "Incredible.", "completion": "The Emperor has given him permission."}
{"prompt": "Never mind.", "completion": "Well, Mozart is already rehearsing."}
{"prompt": "I've seen the manuscript.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "You must be mad.", "completion": "Are you absolutely sure?"}
{"prompt": "He's setting that play to music?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "You mean that play?", "completion": "Exactly."}
{"prompt": "Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.", "completion": "Italian?"}
{"prompt": "I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.", "completion": "Ah."}
{"prompt": "For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.", "completion": "Oh yes, yes. And that was?"}
{"prompt": "Did we?", "completion": "I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?"}
{"prompt": "Well done, Sire!", "completion": "Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.", "completion": "Bravo, Your Majesty!"}
{"prompt": "Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.", "completion": "Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?"}
{"prompt": "Well, promise then.", "completion": "What do you mean - now?"}
{"prompt": "Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.", "completion": "I can't wait."}
{"prompt": "I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.", "completion": "Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck."}
{"prompt": "Here I am, my angel.", "completion": "What? Who the devil are you?"}
{"prompt": "How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.", "completion": "Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes."}
{"prompt": "Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?", "completion": "No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him."}
{"prompt": "This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.", "completion": "I agree, Baron."}
{"prompt": "He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.", "completion": "Come with me. And stay in the room."}
{"prompt": "Show her in. Then go to bed.", "completion": "What does he want?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, my dear.", "completion": "That lady is back, sir."}
{"prompt": "Who is she?", "completion": "She didn't say. But she says it's urgent."}
{"prompt": "Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!", "completion": "Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you."}
{"prompt": "Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.", "completion": "Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?"}
{"prompt": "Bene.", "completion": "I'll call tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.", "completion": "Well, tell him we were here, won't you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.", "completion": "But he's all right?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I am looking after him.", "completion": "Can we come in?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Herr Salieri."}
{"prompt": "You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?", "completion": "I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them."}
{"prompt": "How did he look?", "completion": "What do you mean, 'how did he look'?"}
{"prompt": "Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?", "completion": "The American? Yes, duck."}
{"prompt": "David?", "completion": "I doubt it. But it's something to do."}
{"prompt": "Tea would be nice.", "completion": "Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog."}
{"prompt": "I expect you shortly.", "completion": "What shall we do?"}
{"prompt": "Shall I send a car?", "completion": "No, a cab will be faster."}
{"prompt": "You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?", "completion": "He's fine. We'll come right over."}
{"prompt": "Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "Could you get here without any trouble?", "completion": "Yes, I should think so."}
{"prompt": "Is David acting strangely?", "completion": "No, not really."}
{"prompt": "Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?", "completion": "No, why?"}
{"prompt": "The zoo? Is he rational?", "completion": "Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean."}
{"prompt": "Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?", "completion": "He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo."}
{"prompt": "Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.", "completion": "He's here."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.", "completion": "What shall we do?"}
{"prompt": "David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?", "completion": "Dr. Hirsch?"}
{"prompt": "No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.", "completion": "Surely you're not suggesting..."}
{"prompt": "I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.", "completion": "You've absolutely no idea where David might be?"}
{"prompt": "They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.", "completion": "And what else?"}
{"prompt": "I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Warn him?", "completion": "Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?"}
{"prompt": "What did he say?", "completion": "David says Jack comes to warn him."}
{"prompt": "Has his friend appeared to him again?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?", "completion": "Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend."}
{"prompt": "At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...", "completion": "He's not?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "It's a full moon. Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "Come to my office, Miss Price.", "completion": "Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I believe he did.", "completion": "It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have."}
{"prompt": "No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.", "completion": "Did he say a wolf?"}
{"prompt": "What happened to them?", "completion": "The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price."}
{"prompt": "He said 'Jack'.", "completion": "That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Doctor?", "completion": "What exactly did he call out?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, Doctor.", "completion": "Oh, Miss Price?"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Hirsch?", "completion": "Go about your duties."}
{"prompt": "Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.", "completion": "Can I be of service, Miss Price?"}
{"prompt": "Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!", "completion": "Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago."}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!", "completion": "David, don't lose control."}
{"prompt": "Hopeless. It's hopeless.", "completion": "David, let's go now."}
{"prompt": "Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...", "completion": "Will you shut up!?!!"}
{"prompt": "We had an argument. He's being silly.", "completion": "I swear, I don't know this girl."}
{"prompt": "He's playing a stupid joke, sir.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.", "completion": "Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!"}
{"prompt": "Jack is dead!", "completion": "Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police."}
{"prompt": "David, stop!", "completion": "I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I..."}
{"prompt": "David, what are you doing?", "completion": "Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex."}
{"prompt": "But...", "completion": "Pull over."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.", "completion": "I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time."}
{"prompt": "The next corner we can get a cab.", "completion": "I should be committed."}
{"prompt": "Don't you remember?", "completion": "I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind."}
{"prompt": "The zoo?", "completion": "Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?"}
{"prompt": "I'm freezing.", "completion": "Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!"}
{"prompt": "See you later.", "completion": "David! Where on earth have you been!?!"}
{"prompt": "A doper werewolf.", "completion": "I'm off. There's food in the fridge."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "I've left those pills for you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I do, but go to work.", "completion": "Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Werewolves simply do not exist.", "completion": "David, do you want me to stay here tonight?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.", "completion": "It's silly of you to be apprehensive."}
{"prompt": "Do me an enormous favor?", "completion": "Anything."}
{"prompt": "That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.", "completion": "Let me go now, you'll make me late."}
{"prompt": "I wasn't hallucinating.", "completion": "Tomorrow is the full moon."}
{"prompt": "I was awake and he was in my room.", "completion": "But, David."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?"}
{"prompt": "Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Alex?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "It's nice to see you.", "completion": "It's nice to see you."}
{"prompt": "There is only one bed.", "completion": "David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower."}
{"prompt": "Lovely.", "completion": "The bedroom."}
{"prompt": "Charming.", "completion": "Bathroom."}
{"prompt": "Very nice.", "completion": "Closet."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I would think so, too.", "completion": "The kitchen."}
{"prompt": "I was dreaming again?", "completion": "I would think so."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?", "completion": "What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?"}
{"prompt": "My friend Jack was just here.", "completion": "Your dead friend Jack?"}
{"prompt": "I'll let you know the next full moon.", "completion": "You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?"}
{"prompt": "A werewolf?", "completion": "Are you better now?"}
{"prompt": "Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.", "completion": "I'm a werewolf."}
{"prompt": "All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?", "completion": "Now I'm embarrassed."}
{"prompt": "You're being awfully forward, aren't you?", "completion": "Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it."}
{"prompt": "How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?", "completion": "Not just a patient -- me."}
{"prompt": "Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.", "completion": "Will you think about it?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship."}
{"prompt": "David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.", "completion": "Will you come with me?"}
{"prompt": "That's easy enough.", "completion": "I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them."}
{"prompt": "Don't be silly. Can I get you something?", "completion": "No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while."}
{"prompt": "Hello. You all right?", "completion": "I'm sorry I woke you up."}
{"prompt": "Yes, go on.", "completion": "Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd..."}
{"prompt": "What? Oh, yes, please.", "completion": "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?"}
{"prompt": "My best friend. My very best friend.", "completion": "Shall I read to you?"}
{"prompt": "Now what do you want to talk about?", "completion": "Was Jack Goodman your good friend?"}
{"prompt": "I'm twenty-seven.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "How old are you?", "completion": "Twenty-eight."}
{"prompt": "How old are you?", "completion": "That's not really a very proper question."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.", "completion": "It's okay. I want to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "What do you dream about?", "completion": "I dream of death mostly."}
{"prompt": "Do you like it?", "completion": "I've just started it. My friend gave it to me."}
{"prompt": "I was. What are you reading?", "completion": "'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain."}
{"prompt": "You're a very beautiful girl.", "completion": "I thought you were asleep."}
{"prompt": "Let's try a little harder, shall we?", "completion": "Will you give me a break?"}
{"prompt": "This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Call me David.", "completion": "Shall I be forced to feed you, David?"}
{"prompt": "Aw come on, Alex!", "completion": "Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?"}
{"prompt": "Aw come on, Miss Price!", "completion": "Call me Alex."}
{"prompt": "Leave the pills. I'll take them later.", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "How is that?", "completion": "Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?"}
{"prompt": "Please, really. I'm not hungry.", "completion": "You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler."}
{"prompt": "I'm not very hungry, thank you.", "completion": "I'm afraid you have to eat something."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "You haven't eaten your lunch."}
{"prompt": "A wolf.", "completion": "Mr. Kessler?"}
{"prompt": "It was a wolf.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "It wasn't a lunatic.", "completion": "I beg your pardon?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I thought not."}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "No what?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "How are we feeling tonight?"}
{"prompt": "The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Feeling better?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "No what?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Benjamin.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I looked.", "completion": "Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now."}
{"prompt": "I think he's a Jew.", "completion": "Why on earth do you say that?"}
{"prompt": "He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.", "completion": "Chart says he's from New York."}
{"prompt": "He all right?", "completion": "Yes, I should think. He called out just now."}
{"prompt": "Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.", "completion": "Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."}
{"prompt": "Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?", "completion": "Has he been refusing food?"}
{"prompt": "Miss Price.", "completion": "Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."}
{"prompt": "You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.", "completion": "That's what I want you to do, you moron!"}
{"prompt": "Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!", "completion": "Who is this girl?"}
{"prompt": "Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!", "completion": "Now see here young man."}
{"prompt": "Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!", "completion": "There's no call for that kind of language."}
{"prompt": "You did, did you?", "completion": "All right, you two, move along."}
{"prompt": "Why are you doing this to me?", "completion": "Officer, I killed those people last night."}
{"prompt": "That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.", "completion": "No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.", "completion": "You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted."}
{"prompt": "Why are you doing this to me, Jack?", "completion": "This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities."}
{"prompt": "No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!", "completion": "You could have told them!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.", "completion": "That's very funny, that is."}
{"prompt": "Oh, come on, tell us.", "completion": "No. You've had your chance."}
{"prompt": "Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!", "completion": "All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it."}
{"prompt": "No, but we're about to.", "completion": "You be quiet, woman, and let me speak."}
{"prompt": "Bambi?", "completion": "Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?"}
{"prompt": "Some, everyone does.", "completion": "Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?"}
{"prompt": "An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.", "completion": "Do you have bad dreams, too?"}
{"prompt": "Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.", "completion": "What are you going to see?"}
{"prompt": "It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.", "completion": "Alex?"}
{"prompt": "Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.", "completion": "What time is it?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.", "completion": "I was having a nightmare."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.", "completion": "Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price."}
{"prompt": "You really think I'm crazy, don't you?", "completion": "Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake."}
{"prompt": "Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.", "completion": "David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly."}
{"prompt": "Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?", "completion": "I really don't know."}
{"prompt": "Did you see Jack?", "completion": "No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here."}
{"prompt": "Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.", "completion": "You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of."}
{"prompt": "I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.", "completion": "Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?"}
{"prompt": "Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.", "completion": "You've never had bad dreams before?"}
{"prompt": "How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.", "completion": "In time I'm sure it will all come back to you."}
{"prompt": "There were witnesses?", "completion": "So they said."}
{"prompt": "Lunatic?", "completion": "Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now."}
{"prompt": "Two weeks?", "completion": "You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten."}
{"prompt": "How long have I been here?", "completion": "You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago."}
{"prompt": "Miss Price! Miss Price, please!", "completion": "Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?"}
{"prompt": "The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?", "completion": "Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead."}
{"prompt": "London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.", "completion": "I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences."}
{"prompt": "Where am I?", "completion": "You're in a hospital in London."}
{"prompt": "If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.", "completion": "Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins."}
{"prompt": "How shall I do it?", "completion": "I could hang myself."}
{"prompt": "Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.", "completion": "Because this must be stopped."}
{"prompt": "David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.", "completion": "I want you to meet some people."}
{"prompt": "I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.", "completion": "What about the zoo?"}
{"prompt": "You look awful.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?", "completion": "If I was still alive, I probably would."}
{"prompt": "What can I say, Jack?", "completion": "You don't have to say anything."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Jack.", "completion": "Hi, David."}
{"prompt": "The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!", "completion": "I will not accept this! Now go away!"}
{"prompt": "You must believe me.", "completion": "What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream."}
{"prompt": "You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.", "completion": "Jack, are you really dead?"}
{"prompt": "David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...", "completion": "A monster. I know, I know."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Get out of here, Jack!"}
{"prompt": "David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.", "completion": "I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf."}
{"prompt": "I wanted to see you.", "completion": "Okay, you've seen me. Now go away."}
{"prompt": "Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.", "completion": "You're not real."}
{"prompt": "The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.", "completion": "Nurse! Oh God! Alex!"}
{"prompt": "Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.", "completion": "Nurse!"}
{"prompt": "David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.", "completion": "Nurse!"}
{"prompt": "You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.", "completion": "You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!"}
{"prompt": "Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.", "completion": "Jack, please go away. Please go away."}
{"prompt": "Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'", "completion": "Stop it, Jack."}
{"prompt": "You survived and now you shall continue the curse.", "completion": "What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!"}
{"prompt": "It's you, David.", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.", "completion": "Will you be quiet?!"}
{"prompt": "I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.", "completion": "What's wrong with you? Shut up!"}
{"prompt": "On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.", "completion": "Shut up, you zombie!"}
{"prompt": "We were attacked by a werewolf.", "completion": "I'm not listening!"}
{"prompt": "I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.", "completion": "If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!"}
{"prompt": "David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.", "completion": "Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?"}
{"prompt": "David!", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "Life mocks me even in death.", "completion": "I'm going completely crazy."}
{"prompt": "So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.", "completion": "Rudy Levine the shmuck?"}
{"prompt": "Debbie Klein cried a lot.", "completion": "I can't stand it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.", "completion": "Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.", "completion": "Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?"}
{"prompt": "David! You're hurting my feelings.", "completion": "Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!"}
{"prompt": "This is too much. I can't handle this.", "completion": "I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me."}
{"prompt": "Get the fuck out of here, Jack.", "completion": "Thanks a lot."}
{"prompt": "Are you going to help me up?", "completion": "Nice to see you."}
{"prompt": "Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!", "completion": "You really scared me, you shithead."}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "I'll tell you when we get there."}
{"prompt": "Jack?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "It sounds far away.", "completion": "Not far enough. Come on."}
{"prompt": "See anything?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Walk away, Jack.", "completion": "Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away."}
{"prompt": "A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.", "completion": "Nice doggie. Good boy."}
{"prompt": "Do you think it's a dog?", "completion": "Oh shit. What is that?"}
{"prompt": "Let's just keep walking.", "completion": "It's in front of us."}
{"prompt": "What's the plan?", "completion": "Plan?"}
{"prompt": "It's moving.", "completion": "It's circling us."}
{"prompt": "Come on, where?", "completion": "Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving."}
{"prompt": "Shit! David, what is that?", "completion": "I don't know. Come on."}
{"prompt": "I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "No, but he was on the moors.", "completion": "It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'."}
{"prompt": "Heathcliffe.", "completion": "Heathcliffe didn't howl."}
{"prompt": "The Hound of the Baskervilles.", "completion": "Pecos Bill."}
{"prompt": "A coyote.", "completion": "There aren't any coyotes in England."}
{"prompt": "Could be a lot of things.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "I heard that.", "completion": "What was it?"}
{"prompt": "I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.", "completion": "Did you hear that?"}
{"prompt": "I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.", "completion": "Say, David..."}
{"prompt": "I have no idea.", "completion": "Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural."}
{"prompt": "Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.", "completion": "What do you think was wrong?"}
{"prompt": "That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.", "completion": "I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob."}
{"prompt": "Beware the moon?", "completion": "Come on, I'm freezing."}
{"prompt": "What the hell was that all about?", "completion": "I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!", "completion": "Apparently so."}
{"prompt": "Jack, we'd better go.", "completion": "What do you mean? I'm starving."}
{"prompt": "Go on, ask them.", "completion": "You ask them."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Wrong."}
{"prompt": "Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.", "completion": "I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters."}
{"prompt": "Ask them what the candles are for.", "completion": "You ask them."}
{"prompt": "It's a five-pointed star.", "completion": "Maybe the owners are from Texas."}
{"prompt": "Look at that.", "completion": "What about it?"}
{"prompt": "Nice looking group.", "completion": "Listen, at least it's warm in here."}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "Nice to see you."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Shall we?"}
{"prompt": "David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.", "completion": "I assume full responsibility."}
{"prompt": "That's not a spear. It's a pike.", "completion": "A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol."}
{"prompt": "That's a wolf's head.", "completion": "Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?"}
{"prompt": "The Slaughtered Lamb?", "completion": "Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?"}
{"prompt": "We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?", "completion": "She says she 'likes me too much'."}
{"prompt": "It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.", "completion": "It is impossible for a body like that to be dull."}
{"prompt": "If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.", "completion": "I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared..."}
{"prompt": "I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.", "completion": "Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?"}
{"prompt": "She's a jerk.", "completion": "You're talking about the woman I love."}
{"prompt": "I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.", "completion": "Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I like it here.", "completion": "I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later."}
{"prompt": "You're not having a good time are you?", "completion": "Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?"}
{"prompt": "Jack.", "completion": "David."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.", "completion": "Are you cold?"}
{"prompt": "Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.", "completion": "What can we do to assist you?"}
{"prompt": "Why don't we ask him?", "completion": "The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think..."}
{"prompt": "You were saying?", "completion": "Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?"}
{"prompt": "No, thank you, Doctor.", "completion": "Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Hirsch?", "completion": "Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?"}
{"prompt": "He's on the telephone.", "completion": "Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!"}
{"prompt": "Roger Mathison, Doctor.", "completion": "What here?"}
{"prompt": "Send them in.", "completion": "Excuse me.  Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.", "completion": "I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?"}
{"prompt": "I suppose Guinness will suffice.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Campari and soda would do nicely.", "completion": "Sorry, love."}
{"prompt": "I beg your pardon?", "completion": "Hello, there. What can I get you?"}
{"prompt": "But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.", "completion": "Remember the Alamo?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.", "completion": "Then you have some hot tea?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Hot chocolate?"}
{"prompt": "We'll find him, not to worry.", "completion": "Do you have any hot soup?"}
{"prompt": "That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.", "completion": "I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that."}
{"prompt": "And what, Sergeant?", "completion": "I don't rightly know, sir."}
{"prompt": "Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.", "completion": "Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and..."}
{"prompt": "Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?", "completion": "He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man."}
{"prompt": "I'd like some tea, please.", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Yeah - sure!", "completion": "No, thank you."}
{"prompt": "If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?", "completion": "Yes - sure\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "But listen, Tom, I\ufffd", "completion": "What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment."}
{"prompt": "Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest\ufffd", "completion": "I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want.

{"prompt": "No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.", "completion": "Where's Matt?"}
{"prompt": "I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.", "completion": "No kidding?"}
{"prompt": "Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.", "completion": "Oscar, what's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning."}
{"prompt": "I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.", "completion": "I remember once when your account checked."}

{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Let me have ten bucks?"}
{"prompt": "Here's twenty-five thousand.", "completion": "Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?"}
{"prompt": "It was more than that last week.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "About twenty-four thousand."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "And tell him not to delay."}
{"prompt": "Not yet, Mr. Clark.", "completion": "When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room."}
{"prompt": "All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.", "completion": "Mr. Dickson in yet?"}
{"prompt": "Take it easy, Clark.", "completion": "You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control."}
{"prompt": "What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!", "completion": "How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!"}
{"prompt": "Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust\ufffd", "completion": "What good will that do?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.", "completion": "Don't make me laugh, Schultz!"}
{"prompt": "You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.", "completion": "Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right."}
{"prompt": "Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!", "completion": "We've been waiting fifteen minutes\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.", "completion": "The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it."}
{"prompt": "Say, you can't do that\ufffd", "completion": "I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill."}
{"prompt": "No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.", "completion": "So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever."}
{"prompt": "The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?", "completion": "Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob."}
{"prompt": "That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?", "completion": "I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean, help?", "completion": "I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes."}
{"prompt": "We'll discuss that in the board room.", "completion": "We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?"}
{"prompt": "We want to talk to you.", "completion": "What about?"}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!", "completion": "Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me."}
{"prompt": "I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!", "completion": "I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!"}
{"prompt": "Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.", "completion": "Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them."}
{"prompt": "Just pure luck!", "completion": "Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?", "completion": "What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?"}
{"prompt": "Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything\ufffd", "completion": "I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind."}
{"prompt": "Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.", "completion": "He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.", "completion": "I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!"}
{"prompt": "They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.", "completion": "I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!"}
{"prompt": "Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!", "completion": "What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?"}
{"prompt": "All right, Jack, all right.", "completion": "Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you."}
{"prompt": "It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings \"Mother Machree\" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.", "completion": "Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming \"Mother Machree.\""}
{"prompt": "You understand?", "completion": "Why, of course."}
{"prompt": "If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.", "completion": "Oh!"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.", "completion": "Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?"}
{"prompt": "That's very simple. I was home.", "completion": "That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary."}
{"prompt": "Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?", "completion": "Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?"}
{"prompt": "Get out, get out!", "completion": "I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett."}
{"prompt": "She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.", "completion": "She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.", "completion": "You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?"}
{"prompt": "But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!", "completion": "What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?"}
{"prompt": "Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!", "completion": "Fifty thousand dollars!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.", "completion": "What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!", "completion": "Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?"}
{"prompt": "Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?", "completion": "But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?"}
{"prompt": "You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.", "completion": "know, but\ufffd"}

{"prompt": "Good for you. Come on.", "completion": "You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?", "completion": "No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals\ufffd  I think I will have a drink."}
{"prompt": "Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.", "completion": "No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home."}
{"prompt": "My apartment.", "completion": "I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home."}
{"prompt": "Cyril!", "completion": "What's this?"}

{"prompt": "Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.", "completion": "Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?", "completion": "See, we're getting along famously!"}
{"prompt": "Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?", "completion": "Doesn't that come next?"}
{"prompt": "Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.", "completion": "But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned."}
{"prompt": "Line?", "completion": "Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women."}
{"prompt": "If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.", "completion": "Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line."}
{"prompt": "What is?", "completion": "\ufffdrunning around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!"}
{"prompt": "Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.", "completion": "Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .", "completion": "Well, you can. You always could."}
{"prompt": "Me?", "completion": "Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that."}
{"prompt": "What is the matter with you? You're trembling?", "completion": "Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . ."}
{"prompt": "This won't do. Not during business hours . . .", "completion": "Why, I needed a\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!", "completion": "I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you."}
{"prompt": "Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.", "completion": "This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?"}
{"prompt": "I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.", "completion": "No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him."}
{"prompt": "I'm not interested in what you think.", "completion": "You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble."}
{"prompt": "Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.", "completion": "Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson."}
{"prompt": "I'm listening.", "completion": "It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah?", "completion": "Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you."}
{"prompt": "Yes, now.", "completion": "The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important."}
{"prompt": "Let me see your cash book, will you?", "completion": "Now?"}
{"prompt": "Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.", "completion": "Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too."}
{"prompt": "Shall we let the people come in?", "completion": "Of course, let them in! You're late now."}
{"prompt": "That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.", "completion": "Thank you!"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?", "completion": "I'm feeling fine this morning."}
{"prompt": "Got a handkerchief?", "completion": "Excuse me\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "John, how's your wife this morning?", "completion": "Much better this morning, thank you."}
{"prompt": "In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .", "completion": "Good morning, Mr. Dickson."}
{"prompt": "Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .", "completion": "Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?"}
{"prompt": "All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.", "completion": "Happy now?"}
{"prompt": "Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?", "completion": "Tomorrow night?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .", "completion": "Well . . ."}
{"prompt": "Ho! Ho! Ho!", "completion": "Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some."}
{"prompt": "You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn\ufffd", "completion": "The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . ."}
{"prompt": "That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?", "completion": "Yes, of course."}
{"prompt": "Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.", "completion": "The theatre?"}
{"prompt": "But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.", "completion": "I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing."}
{"prompt": "I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.", "completion": "Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter dear? What have I done now?", "completion": "Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight."}
{"prompt": "It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.", "completion": "Oooh! That has the earmarks!"}
{"prompt": "Hello, darling.", "completion": "If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.", "completion": "Well, look who's here! Hello, dear."}
{"prompt": "Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!", "completion": "Oh!"}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Helen.", "completion": "Good morning."}
{"prompt": "You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?", "completion": "Numbers? No, never mind."}
{"prompt": "Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "In Mr. Sampson's office.", "completion": "Now don't you worry about it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!", "completion": "Where is he now?"}
{"prompt": "Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Longer.", "completion": "I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either."}
{"prompt": "Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.", "completion": "Directors, eh? Long faces?"}
{"prompt": "Why - well, I\ufffd", "completion": "Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?"}
{"prompt": "Good morning.", "completion": "Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone."}
{"prompt": "All right. Send him in.", "completion": "Helen!"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Mr. Sampson . . ."}
{"prompt": "Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .", "completion": "But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Helen.", "completion": "Mr. Dickson?"}
{"prompt": "Got my letter?", "completion": "Yes, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.", "completion": "Good morning, Mr. Dickson."}
{"prompt": "Looks good. How much did it cost?", "completion": "I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me."}
{"prompt": "Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Oh, make that uniform blue.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Why, I don't know.", "completion": "You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform."}
{"prompt": "No, sir.", "completion": "My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?"}
{"prompt": "I haven't any.", "completion": "You haven't got a uniform?"}
{"prompt": "Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson\ufffd", "completion": "Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.", "completion": "Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week."}
{"prompt": "I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!", "completion": "But I haven't . . ."}
{"prompt": "Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and\ufffd", "completion": "All right. That's all.  Please, Matt."}
{"prompt": "Well . . . uh . . . I . . .", "completion": "She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is\ufffd", "completion": "Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?", "completion": "Was Mrs. Dickson there?"}
{"prompt": "You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?", "completion": "Were you in Cluett's apartment?"}
{"prompt": "We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.", "completion": "Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!", "completion": "Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "No. I won't.", "completion": "You're protecting somebody."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?", "completion": "I can't tell you."}
{"prompt": "I already told him I was home.", "completion": "There you are."}
{"prompt": "Well, I\ufffd", "completion": "I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?"}
{"prompt": "Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.", "completion": "Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?"}
{"prompt": "Sure, I think it's swell.", "completion": "Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real."}
{"prompt": "And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?", "completion": "What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it."}
{"prompt": "You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.", "completion": "It's all right. Thanks."}
{"prompt": "You're lying!", "completion": "Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away."}
{"prompt": "My wife? What's she got to do with you?", "completion": "No wonder he didn't want to mention her name."}
{"prompt": "Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.", "completion": "He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town."}
{"prompt": "Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?", "completion": "You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man."}
{"prompt": "So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they\ufffd", "completion": "Of course it's true - and he knows it."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.", "completion": "Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record."}
{"prompt": "Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.", "completion": "All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty."}
{"prompt": "Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.", "completion": "That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now."}
{"prompt": "All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?", "completion": "If he can do it, yes."}
{"prompt": "What time did this thing happen?", "completion": "The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09."}
{"prompt": "It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.", "completion": "Why pick on him ?"}
{"prompt": "I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.", "completion": "What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion."}
{"prompt": "Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Don't you think I know it?", "completion": "Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!"}
{"prompt": "I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.", "completion": "We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour."}
{"prompt": "The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.", "completion": "What'll we do?"}
{"prompt": "Mine too?", "completion": "Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place."}
{"prompt": "Did you get the case for the securities?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy."}
{"prompt": "We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.", "completion": "The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot."}
{"prompt": "They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.", "completion": "All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away."}
{"prompt": "The lobby's half filled now.", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .", "completion": "He says he can't get away in the daytime."}
{"prompt": "Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.", "completion": "I'm afraid he's been stalling."}
{"prompt": "Well, Sampson, what is it?", "completion": "Here's the data on the Clyde deal."}
{"prompt": "But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!", "completion": "Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!"}
{"prompt": "It's his life insurance money, you know.", "completion": "Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right."}
{"prompt": "Is it safe?", "completion": "Absolutely."}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here."}
{"prompt": "Hardly.", "completion": "Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid so.", "completion": "Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?"}
{"prompt": "He's at a board meeting.", "completion": "Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose."}
{"prompt": "How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.", "completion": "Is that busy husband of mine busy?"}
{"prompt": "The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?", "completion": "Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!"}
{"prompt": "Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.", "completion": "Mr. Williams . . ."}
{"prompt": "Did you talk to him?", "completion": "Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone."}
{"prompt": "Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.", "completion": "Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him."}
{"prompt": "Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.", "completion": "They must have turned him down."}
{"prompt": "Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.", "completion": "What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?"}
{"prompt": "All right, dear.", "completion": "Oh, Matt . . ."}
{"prompt": "Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that\ufffd", "completion": "Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs."}
{"prompt": "Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.", "completion": "Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in."}
{"prompt": "Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]", "completion": "Oh now, don't be silly."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Charlie again.", "completion": "Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.", "completion": "What's keeping you?"}
{"prompt": "I tell you, I saw them!", "completion": "In Cluett's office?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he was making love to her.", "completion": "Oh Matt, you must be mistaken."}
{"prompt": "Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.", "completion": "Well . . . ?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, swell.", "completion": "What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Matt.", "completion": "Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Oh, you think I'm lying?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?"}
{"prompt": "The ten dollars.", "completion": "Oh, ten dollars\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "What did you do with it?", "completion": "With what?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!", "completion": "Oh, is that so?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Come here, honey!"}
{"prompt": "Hello, Helen!", "completion": "Matt, come here!"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "He was here?", "completion": "He came to see Mr. Cluett."}
{"prompt": "Yes, why?", "completion": "He was in the bank yesterday."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Did you say Dude Finlay?"}
{"prompt": "He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.", "completion": "Dude Finlay?"}
{"prompt": "I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.", "completion": "Never mind all that. What did you find out?"}
{"prompt": "That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.", "completion": "What did you find out, Mike?"}
{"prompt": "There you are!", "completion": "Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.", "completion": "No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one."}
{"prompt": "It couldn't have been earlier?", "completion": "No. It wasn't earlier because..."}
{"prompt": "Was it twelve o'clock?", "completion": "Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause..."}
{"prompt": "I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?", "completion": "That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . ."}
{"prompt": "What time did Matt Brown get in?", "completion": "Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "What time was it?", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?", "completion": "It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know."}
{"prompt": "Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.", "completion": "\ufffdfor the rheumatism, you know."}
{"prompt": "Then where were you?", "completion": "Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . ."}
{"prompt": "Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.", "completion": "Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "What time did you get in?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "So you were home last night?"}
{"prompt": "You used to carry a gun, didn't you?", "completion": "Then who changed it?"}
{"prompt": "Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?", "completion": "I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!"}
{"prompt": "You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?", "completion": "wasn't anywhere near this place\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!", "completion": "They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it."}
{"prompt": "Where's Charlie?", "completion": "Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it."}
{"prompt": "Everybody in?", "completion": "I guess so."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, what did he do with his first one?", "completion": "Bought himself a pocketbook!"}
{"prompt": "You've got enough?", "completion": "That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar."}
{"prompt": "How are you fixed?", "completion": "I'm okay, Matt."}
{"prompt": "You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.", "completion": "Okay, Matt."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes a wound will kill.", "completion": "Now you tell us."}
{"prompt": "Jim Younger, I told you--", "completion": "This is healing?"}
{"prompt": "Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...", "completion": "I couldn't lose him."}
{"prompt": "I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.", "completion": "I think I may just go on to the reservation."}
{"prompt": "It's tougher than it looks.", "completion": "You can ride like that?"}
{"prompt": "Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says \"Let's ride.\"", "completion": "He's not bad at it."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Cole.", "completion": "You're just upset about Jesse. We all are."}
{"prompt": "I swear --", "completion": "Swear on Jimmy's grave."}
{"prompt": "Bob. I didn't...", "completion": "Swear."}
{"prompt": "I ain't done --", "completion": "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!"}
{"prompt": "How'd they --", "completion": "What have you done?"}
{"prompt": "Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.", "completion": "Leave me alone, Bob."}
{"prompt": "That was because of... the reputation the gang had.", "completion": "As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve."}
{"prompt": "This is the best score yet.", "completion": "It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to."}

{"prompt": "We got a problem here, brother?", "completion": "Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out."}
{"prompt": "How?", "completion": "Say we bust into a bank. We yell \"We're the Younger-James Gang!\" People are gonna be thinking, \"The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?\" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms."}
{"prompt": "You stay out of this, Bob.", "completion": "No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing."}
{"prompt": "Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.", "completion": "Uhh, yeah it does."}
{"prompt": "I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.", "completion": "These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad."}
{"prompt": "Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.", "completion": "The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys."}
{"prompt": "Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.", "completion": "Zee, I'm pleased you came."}
{"prompt": "Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.", "completion": "That was two hours ago."}
{"prompt": "Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.", "completion": "Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty."}
{"prompt": "He's smiling.", "completion": "Never a good thing."}
{"prompt": "Gatling! They've got a Gatling!", "completion": "Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!"}

{"prompt": "Oh no...", "completion": "He just lost his temper a little."}
{"prompt": "Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.", "completion": "They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper."}
{"prompt": "... Will Perry ...", "completion": "Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay."}
{"prompt": "Then I love it.", "completion": "Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ..."}
{"prompt": "Corn gonna shoot at me?", "completion": "Nope."}
{"prompt": "Yesterday.", "completion": "Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!"}
{"prompt": "My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.", "completion": "I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction."}
{"prompt": "Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...", "completion": "Tell me."}
{"prompt": "He's planning a job.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.", "completion": "He's been full of vinegar lately."}
{"prompt": "The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...", "completion": "You are a fine figure of a man."}
{"prompt": "This is about the \"Wanted!\" Posters, isn't it.", "completion": "Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies."}
{"prompt": "Beg pardon?", "completion": "You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...", "completion": "One false move and I'll blow your heads off!"}
{"prompt": "Hey!", "completion": "\"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars.\""}
{"prompt": "We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.", "completion": "\"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk.\""}
{"prompt": "All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.", "completion": "Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him."}
{"prompt": "But if we take their money and supplies...", "completion": "Exactly."}
{"prompt": "You have no shame.", "completion": "Not yet. But I'm hoping."}
{"prompt": "How many of them did he kill?", "completion": "Two."}
{"prompt": "Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.", "completion": "Best damn plan I heard all war."}

{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!"}
{"prompt": "Where'd you get all these riders?", "completion": "We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw."}
{"prompt": "You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --", "completion": "Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind."}
{"prompt": "Missed you, cousin.", "completion": "Missed you too, cousin."}
{"prompt": "WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!", "completion": "Who's next? You? Me? Bob?"}
{"prompt": "We'll make them pay for this.", "completion": "I'm out."}
{"prompt": "Bob, rip up some bandages.", "completion": "Pass me some whisky."}
{"prompt": "Okay, you're gonna rest here.", "completion": "Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!"}
{"prompt": "Dammit!", "completion": "A trap."}
{"prompt": "Fine. We hit this bank.", "completion": "You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!"}
{"prompt": "Still smells fishy.", "completion": "Then let me run the show, General Lee."}
{"prompt": "I'm the better soldier, Jesse.", "completion": "And I'm the better outlaw."}
{"prompt": "And almost got hanged in peacetime.", "completion": "That's it."}
{"prompt": "A bad idea.", "completion": "I got us through the War all right."}
{"prompt": "Beautiful.", "completion": "Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --"}
{"prompt": "I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.", "completion": "You're forgetting who's in charge --"}
{"prompt": "If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.", "completion": "What are you saying?"}
{"prompt": "What will be?", "completion": "Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper."}
{"prompt": "Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.", "completion": "It'll be the biggest score yet."}
{"prompt": "Why aren't we the \"Younger-James Gang\"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.", "completion": "This is your fault for hogging all the publicity."}
{"prompt": "All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the \"James-Younger Gang.\"", "completion": "Yep."}
{"prompt": "Jesse, we got to have a word.", "completion": "Sure, cousin."}
{"prompt": "\"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men.\"", "completion": "Twenty?!"}
{"prompt": "It's not a bank.", "completion": "It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job."}
{"prompt": "See, Frank's being smart about this.", "completion": "Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart."}
{"prompt": "I got seven thousand.", "completion": "I got three."}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "Don't let it happen again."}
{"prompt": "Let's ride.", "completion": "The James-Younger Gang."}
{"prompt": "I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.", "completion": "Perfect, Cole."}
{"prompt": "So what do we do, General Lee?", "completion": "Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day."}
{"prompt": "But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?", "completion": "Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns."}
{"prompt": "The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.", "completion": "It was exciting."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the help.", "completion": "After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?"}
{"prompt": "She was European!", "completion": "All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --"}
{"prompt": "She got two of them.", "completion": "She had a moustache."}
{"prompt": "In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.", "completion": "You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?"}
{"prompt": "Not now.", "completion": "What is wrong with you?"}
{"prompt": "You're not scared, are you?", "completion": "Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that."}
{"prompt": "Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.", "completion": "Hands off your hip, Cole."}
{"prompt": "There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.", "completion": "Home, boys. Back to our farms."}
{"prompt": "Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!", "completion": "Where you boys going?"}
{"prompt": "Ride with me, cousin?", "completion": "I could use the walk."}
{"prompt": "'Bout time you got here, buddy.", "completion": "What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "I'm thinking..."}
{"prompt": "Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.", "completion": "Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you..."}
{"prompt": "Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!", "completion": "You ride like a Comanche."}
{"prompt": "Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.", "completion": "You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are."}
{"prompt": "They gonna rush us?", "completion": "They're just insurance in case we run."}
{"prompt": "Cole, he didn't mean that.", "completion": "Another dozen out back."}
{"prompt": "Jesse.", "completion": "Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?"}
{"prompt": "Strategically.", "completion": "-- Exactly. Because this is a war."}
{"prompt": "Get buckets!", "completion": "Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --"}
{"prompt": "Ah.", "completion": "BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!"}
{"prompt": "I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.", "completion": "Shakespeare.  He's European."}

{"prompt": "Of course!  Uh, sir?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Me get heap firewater --", "completion": "The safe. Now."}
{"prompt": "Ho-yah!", "completion": "Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!"}
{"prompt": "Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.", "completion": "East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?"}
{"prompt": "The District Marshall", "completion": "Of St. Louis?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Injun. What do you want?", "completion": "Great Chief of St. Louis send me."}
{"prompt": "I'd appreciate that.", "completion": "You 'um big lawman?"}
{"prompt": "It's a secret.", "completion": "Fine. I'll just wait here."}
{"prompt": "On account of we're robbing it.", "completion": "Oh. Why didn't you just say so?"}
{"prompt": "You're right, sir.", "completion": "Then why can't I go in there?"}
{"prompt": "Shit.", "completion": "I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!"}
{"prompt": "Where the hell were you?", "completion": "I had you covered.  From back there."}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank."}
{"prompt": "It's fine by me, Jesse.", "completion": "What the --"}
{"prompt": "You know you're welcome any time!", "completion": "Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out."}
{"prompt": "What do you say, sir?", "completion": "Go on. You're pretty much all healed up."}
{"prompt": "Boys...", "completion": "Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys."}
{"prompt": "Web died fighting?", "completion": "Died a hero."}
{"prompt": "My little Web did that?", "completion": "Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them."}
{"prompt": "I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.", "completion": "-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee."}
{"prompt": "I think he's already feeling better.", "completion": "He thinks this is some kind of game!"}
{"prompt": "I fooled them into thinking I was alone.", "completion": "Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning."}
{"prompt": "The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.", "completion": "They're gone. What are you --"}
{"prompt": "Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?", "completion": "He's going to be fine, right Daddy?"}
{"prompt": "Hell, they hardly even noticed us.", "completion": "Daddy, don't start with this again."}
{"prompt": "I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.", "completion": "See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there."}
{"prompt": "A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?", "completion": "I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time."}
{"prompt": "You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?", "completion": "Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him."}
{"prompt": "Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.", "completion": "Jim was old enough..."}
{"prompt": "They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.", "completion": "Got any ideas, little brother?"}
{"prompt": "You taking sides against me, now, Frank?", "completion": "No, I --"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah.", "completion": "Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad."}
{"prompt": "A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?", "completion": "We're drunk."}
{"prompt": "Maybe it started out that way. But now...", "completion": "What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming."}
{"prompt": "I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.", "completion": "We're doing this for Ma."}
{"prompt": "If I could go back to farming --", "completion": "That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen."}
{"prompt": "It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.", "completion": "You've killed your fair share of men."}
{"prompt": "Jesse, we're outlaws.", "completion": "And we're good at it."}
{"prompt": "Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.", "completion": "This has been a good year."}
{"prompt": "The posters?", "completion": "Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!"}
{"prompt": "Gents, we are in the middle of something here.", "completion": "Bob's upset."}
{"prompt": "I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?", "completion": "It's the scientific method. It's all the rage."}
{"prompt": "And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.", "completion": "And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives."}
{"prompt": "And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --", "completion": "And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?"}
{"prompt": "Fine. How'd it go out here?", "completion": "We're gonna have to talk..."}
{"prompt": "Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.", "completion": "How'd it go in there?"}
{"prompt": "Don't care.", "completion": "Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin."}
{"prompt": "Ma.", "completion": "... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else."}
{"prompt": "Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?", "completion": "Pinkertons. It's the railroad."}
{"prompt": "Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.", "completion": "You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --"}
{"prompt": "You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.", "completion": "Damn. All that reading paid off."}
{"prompt": "You know him?", "completion": "Heard of him."}
{"prompt": "-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.", "completion": "Your Zee? Hmm.  \"From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world.\""}

{"prompt": "Maybe, maybe...", "completion": "\"Big and older\"?"}
{"prompt": "What kind of story are they going to believe?", "completion": "That just might work."}
{"prompt": "All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.", "completion": "Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right."}
{"prompt": "Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.", "completion": "Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth."}
{"prompt": "You're doing just fine.", "completion": "Zee, we got to talk to you and your father."}
{"prompt": "We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.", "completion": "Frank, don't you have something to say?"}
{"prompt": "All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.", "completion": "Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.", "completion": "Hello, Liberty Missoura!"}
{"prompt": "I reckoned.", "completion": "Hell of a war."}
{"prompt": "No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.", "completion": "Web's dead."}
{"prompt": "I figure.", "completion": "See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it."}
{"prompt": "You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.", "completion": "That would have made an impression."}
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Such as?"}
{"prompt": "Pff. They hardly even noticed you.", "completion": "So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention."}
{"prompt": "So we got a plan?", "completion": "Distracting enough for you?"}
{"prompt": "Everything but the boring parts.", "completion": "Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off."}
{"prompt": "Yeah Jimmy?", "completion": "How much of that story is true?"}
{"prompt": "I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.", "completion": "Uncle Frank?"}
{"prompt": "Can't argue that.", "completion": "So what was he?"}
{"prompt": "Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.", "completion": "But he killed a lot of men, too."}
{"prompt": "That he was.", "completion": "They're making him a hero now."}
{"prompt": "Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.", "completion": "Sounds like he was a hell of a man."}
{"prompt": "...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.", "completion": "I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy."}

{"prompt": "We're just fine, thank you, sir.", "completion": "The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them."}
{"prompt": "He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.", "completion": "Easterners."}
{"prompt": "Say your prayers?", "completion": "Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend."}
{"prompt": "Did you kill Yankees?", "completion": "A fair number, Ma."}

{"prompt": "Don't swear.", "completion": "Yes ma'am."}

{"prompt": "Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?", "completion": "Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?"}

{"prompt": "Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?", "completion": "You were little Jesse James when you left."}
{"prompt": "I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.", "completion": "Fair enough."}
{"prompt": "The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.", "completion": "He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife."}
{"prompt": "Ahh, you'll miss me.", "completion": "No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit."}
{"prompt": "I'm not hanged yet.", "completion": "You cocky little bastard."}
{"prompt": "Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.", "completion": "That's what I would have done."}
{"prompt": "I figured.", "completion": "Was it worth it?"}
{"prompt": "No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.", "completion": "Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know."}
{"prompt": "Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.", "completion": "I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much."}
{"prompt": "The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.", "completion": "Damn."}
{"prompt": "You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Last February?", "completion": "Mmm."}
{"prompt": "Pity.", "completion": "How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?"}
{"prompt": "Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.", "completion": "You almost ended my career before it began."}
{"prompt": "That's the idea.", "completion": "Did you order our houses burned down?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.", "completion": "So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?"}
{"prompt": "We're moving you tomorrow.", "completion": "But I like the presidential suite."}
{"prompt": "Right here in church?", "completion": "Communion."}
{"prompt": "Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.", "completion": "Now let's have a drink."}
{"prompt": "Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  \"Jesse Woodson James.\" Jesse James? The Jesse James?", "completion": "I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your..."}
{"prompt": "This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.", "completion": "You don't think God'll mind, do you?"}
{"prompt": "Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...", "completion": "You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy."}
{"prompt": "... too young for whisky...", "completion": "This time we'll make an exception."}
{"prompt": "What about that Rock Island bastard?", "completion": "It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?"}
{"prompt": "Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.", "completion": "You do that."}
{"prompt": "You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?", "completion": "I swear."}
{"prompt": "Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?", "completion": "I think so."}
{"prompt": "Well, not exactly.", "completion": "You been with a girl ever?"}
{"prompt": "Jim, you been with a girl yet?", "completion": "Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm."}
{"prompt": "I guess so.", "completion": "I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.", "completion": "Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "You okay, Jesse?"}
{"prompt": "And the same age Web was. No.", "completion": "I like that."}
{"prompt": "And you're too young.", "completion": "I'm the same age you were when you went off to war."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Don't talk about it much, though."}
{"prompt": "That is so gentlemanly of you.", "completion": "Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once."}
{"prompt": "Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.", "completion": "Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?"}
{"prompt": "Lyla Devereux.", "completion": "Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?"}
{"prompt": "I just though you were awful cute.", "completion": "Thank you, Miss -- ?"}
{"prompt": "I hope I'm not being too forward.", "completion": "Not at all."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.", "completion": "Oh, you were talking to Jesse."}
{"prompt": "Move you fools!", "completion": "Why, yeah."}
{"prompt": "They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.", "completion": "There's only four of them..."}
{"prompt": "By burning down their homes?", "completion": "How can that be?"}
{"prompt": "My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.", "completion": "They had to be dealt with!"}
{"prompt": "Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.", "completion": "It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case."}
{"prompt": "Well, this land is about to be condemned.", "completion": "I'm doing you folks a favor --"}
{"prompt": "How did you know?", "completion": "Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?"}
{"prompt": "This is him.", "completion": "I remember you."}
{"prompt": "That.", "completion": "Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain."}
{"prompt": "What is that?", "completion": "What, sir?"}
{"prompt": "Parker.", "completion": "Sir?"}
{"prompt": "The final route for the railroad is complete.", "completion": "I look forward to seeing it."}
{"prompt": "With my money!", "completion": "We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Your men knew the risks.", "completion": "What is going on here, man?"}
{"prompt": "THEN WHO DID?!", "completion": "We did."}
{"prompt": "I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!", "completion": "To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks."}
{"prompt": "How much did they get from the safe?", "completion": "Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --"}
{"prompt": "I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.", "completion": "They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile."}
{"prompt": "You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.", "completion": "I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight."}
{"prompt": "Just perfect.", "completion": "A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers."}
{"prompt": "Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.", "completion": "Yes sir."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident."}
{"prompt": "Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.", "completion": "Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers."}
{"prompt": "NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!", "completion": "I can completely understand your distress, sir."}
{"prompt": "And it is my pleasure to be here.", "completion": "Really!"}
{"prompt": "Vengeance.", "completion": "Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field."}
{"prompt": "Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.", "completion": "What the hell is that sound?"}
{"prompt": "No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.", "completion": "What is that?"}
{"prompt": "There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.", "completion": "Can you put men at all four?"}
{"prompt": "Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.", "completion": "In English, Pinkerton."}
{"prompt": "So he's won.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Can't you tell me anything?", "completion": "It's going to be a long spring."}
{"prompt": "I demand action.", "completion": "No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?"}
{"prompt": "And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.", "completion": "Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side."}
{"prompt": "First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.", "completion": "I can't believe this."}
{"prompt": "Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.", "completion": "All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning."}
{"prompt": "So you can't tell me anything?", "completion": "It's going to be a long winter."}
{"prompt": "I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!", "completion": "Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create."}
{"prompt": "Oh, that's the best part.", "completion": "It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns."}
{"prompt": "It is a nice piece of writing.", "completion": "\"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!\"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.", "completion": "\"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West.\""}
{"prompt": "Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.", "completion": "This is no game."}
{"prompt": "Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.", "completion": "I want them arrested and hanged!"}
{"prompt": "Not to mention my men who lost their lives.", "completion": "You wouldn't have done that?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least."}
{"prompt": "Patrick?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Isn't that special?  Patrick?", "completion": "Yes, Courtney?"}
{"prompt": "Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?", "completion": "You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less."}
{"prompt": "I never knew you smoked.", "completion": "You never noticed."}
{"prompt": "You and...Luis?", "completion": "We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is..."}
{"prompt": "Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.", "completion": "That's nice."}
{"prompt": "Maybe.", "completion": "What are you doing tonight?"}
{"prompt": "Oh God, just get it over with.", "completion": "Will you call me before Thanksgiving?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.", "completion": "See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?"}
{"prompt": "Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip \ufffd  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?", "completion": "Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!"}
{"prompt": "Take it off.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.", "completion": "It's a plain end, see? So?"}
{"prompt": "Turn the light on.", "completion": "Oh Jesus. I'm going home."}
{"prompt": "What do you want, Courtney?", "completion": "It's a plain end. I think."}
{"prompt": "I'm ignoring you.", "completion": "Pull out, goddamnit!"}
{"prompt": "Is it a what?", "completion": "Pull out."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.", "completion": "No, you idiot. I said \"Is it a receptacle tip?\" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me."}
{"prompt": "Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.", "completion": "Luis is a despicable twit."}
{"prompt": "Yes, dear.", "completion": "Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish.\" You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "This is Dorsia?"}
{"prompt": "Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.", "completion": "Are we here?"}
{"prompt": "I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...", "completion": "J&B. Straight."}
{"prompt": "Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.", "completion": "You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump."}
{"prompt": "A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.", "completion": "Is that Donald Trump's car?"}
{"prompt": "Pick me up?", "completion": "Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. Yeah. What time?", "completion": "Eight?"}
{"prompt": "You like it there, don't you?", "completion": "The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight."}
{"prompt": "Dorsia's nice.", "completion": "Nice?"}
{"prompt": "I can't.", "completion": "I'm thinking Dorsia."}
{"prompt": "Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.", "completion": "Courtney? Dinner?"}
{"prompt": "I know. Stop it.", "completion": "Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed."}
{"prompt": "Uh huh.", "completion": "Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Pumpkin you're dating an asshole."}
{"prompt": "Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.", "completion": "Pumpkin?"}
{"prompt": "You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?", "completion": "Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?"}
{"prompt": "On a lot of lithium?", "completion": "Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick."}
{"prompt": "Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?", "completion": "Stop it. I'm..."}
{"prompt": "Listen, what are you doing tonight?", "completion": "What? Oh, I'm...busy."}
{"prompt": "This is nicer than your other apartment.", "completion": "It's not that nice."}
{"prompt": "My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.", "completion": "Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here."}
{"prompt": "Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Alright.", "completion": "So, you're looking great, how have you been?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think so.", "completion": "Nothing like last time, promise."}
{"prompt": "I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...", "completion": "Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise."}
{"prompt": "You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?", "completion": "Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap."}
{"prompt": "I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.", "completion": "Do you take American Express?"}
{"prompt": "Would you like to see my apartment?", "completion": "Do you want to come to my apartment or not?"}
{"prompt": "I haven't seen you around here.", "completion": "You just haven't been looking."}
{"prompt": "But where?", "completion": "I have to return some videotapes."}
{"prompt": "Where are you going?", "completion": "I'm just leaving."}
{"prompt": "Oh God, I can't believe this.", "completion": "I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going."}
{"prompt": "I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.", "completion": "If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now."}

{"prompt": "I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.", "completion": "You're really serious, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.", "completion": "But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip."}
{"prompt": "It's over, Evelyn. It's all over", "completion": "Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?"}
{"prompt": "We need to talk.", "completion": "Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?"}
{"prompt": "Why? What's wrong?", "completion": "My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs."}
{"prompt": "I want a firm commitment.", "completion": "I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch."}

{"prompt": "How did you guess?", "completion": "Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman."}

{"prompt": "You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole.

{"prompt": "Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.", "completion": "Excuse me. I really must he going."}

{"prompt": "Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.", "completion": "What are you talking about? Bateman is what?"}

{"prompt": "Like what?", "completion": "Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice."}

You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?"}

{"prompt": "Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?", "completion": "What do you mean, she was a hot number."}
{"prompt": "He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and \ufffd  - you.", "completion": "Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night."}

{"prompt": "But how? Where do you place Paul that night?", "completion": "According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam."}

{"prompt": "Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.", "completion": "Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers."}
{"prompt": "Great, yes, I'd like that.", "completion": "And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier."}
{"prompt": "Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.", "completion": "Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?"}
{"prompt": "We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's.

{"prompt": "Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?", "completion": "God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?", "completion": "Not really."}
{"prompt": "Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.", "completion": "I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence."}
{"prompt": "Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?", "completion": "I mean they want to get caught."}
{"prompt": "0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?", "completion": "Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump."}

{"prompt": "I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?", "completion": "No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything."}
{"prompt": "Had his apartment been burglarized?", "completion": "No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it."}

{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?"}
{"prompt": "Hmmm.", "completion": "Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so..."}
{"prompt": "But...has anyone seen him in London?", "completion": "Actually, yes."}
{"prompt": "Well, maybe he did, huh?", "completion": "His girlfriend doesn't think so."}

{"prompt": "Milo --", "completion": "I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself."}

{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you."}
{"prompt": "Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...", "completion": "Look at this."}

{"prompt": "Poor baby. You know that's not true.", "completion": "That was -- different."}

{"prompt": "I remember.", "completion": "After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary."}
{"prompt": "Remember Lyle Barton?", "completion": "The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --"}
{"prompt": "It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.", "completion": "...Why?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "Nothing?"}
{"prompt": "So you believe me?", "completion": "It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?"}
{"prompt": "I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.", "completion": "...Whaddo I do?"}

{"prompt": "I can't just walk away!", "completion": "You can't just walk in, either."}

That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.", "completion": "Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?

{"prompt": "Go where? You can't get away from people like this.", "completion": "\"Like this?\" It's Gary you're talking about."}
{"prompt": "It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.", "completion": "You're scaring me. I think we should just go."}
{"prompt": "They hack into people's programs?", "completion": "Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus."}
{"prompt": "I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.", "completion": "I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says \"Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?\" It's like they know what every kid's doing."}

{"prompt": "What!", "completion": "Teddy was killed last night."}
{"prompt": "I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --", "completion": "You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting."}

{"prompt": "That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.", "completion": "He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, \"Did you really do this just today?\" Cause I was impressed. He said \"What're you implying?\""}

{"prompt": "You saved my life in alot of ways.", "completion": "When's Brian coming for the TV?"}
{"prompt": "C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --", "completion": "Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?"}
{"prompt": "I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.", "completion": "No way. You have this -- destiny."}
{"prompt": "...But?", "completion": "Didn't you visit the campus?"}
{"prompt": "If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.", "completion": "I think that's great, Milo. I do."}
{"prompt": "When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.", "completion": "But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?"}
{"prompt": "If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.", "completion": "Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad."}
{"prompt": "Then you've gotta ask him about that.", "completion": "It's important."}
{"prompt": "C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.", "completion": "A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --"}
{"prompt": "I don't think he knows how.", "completion": "I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff."}
{"prompt": "He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich\ufffd about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.", "completion": "He wasn't acting?"}
{"prompt": "Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.", "completion": "Prick."}
{"prompt": "That'll be a test, won't it?", "completion": "Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something."}
{"prompt": "Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?", "completion": "He'll tell me when he gets home."}
{"prompt": "'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "And Outpost? You're happy there?", "completion": "Yes sir."}
{"prompt": "Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.", "completion": "'Just didn't know who else to talk to."}
{"prompt": "If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.", "completion": "I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis."}
{"prompt": "My goodness.", "completion": "It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?"}
{"prompt": "Milo?", "completion": "My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley."}
{"prompt": "What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.", "completion": "I am. I am, sir."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.", "completion": "Have a seat."}
{"prompt": "Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.", "completion": "Milo?"}

{"prompt": "Like I said: shot in the dark.", "completion": "Mr. Barton, do you remember me?"}
{"prompt": "Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.", "completion": "It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something..."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.", "completion": "Right... What's that mean again?"}
{"prompt": "...When did you know?", "completion": "You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects."}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?"}
{"prompt": "Is it your software?", "completion": "Is it your dish?"}
{"prompt": "You're interfaced with our dish.", "completion": "Gimme the coordinates?"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "Wanna be a part of history?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What'd they ever do for you?"}
{"prompt": "Will I get to work for Outpost?", "completion": "No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost."}
{"prompt": "You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.", "completion": "Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life."}
{"prompt": "'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.", "completion": "This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner."}
{"prompt": "Sure, I'll see what I can do.", "completion": "Well I parked illegally. See y'later?"}
{"prompt": "You're living here?", "completion": "'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?"}
{"prompt": "We tried!", "completion": "You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up."}
{"prompt": "And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.", "completion": "Milo. Surprised he's not your guest."}
{"prompt": "Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?", "completion": "Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world."}
{"prompt": "That'd change with a criminal indictment.", "completion": "There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished."}
{"prompt": "Outpost doesn't own em.", "completion": "Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line."}
{"prompt": "That's gotta kill him, right?", "completion": "Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally."}
{"prompt": "Who's that?", "completion": "I think they call him the \"Houseman.\" 'Cause \"guard\" sounds too weird."}
{"prompt": "We could move 'em up here.", "completion": "He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything."}
{"prompt": "'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?", "completion": "He's pretty tight with his family."}
{"prompt": "Milo? I'm Danny.", "completion": "Oh hi."}
{"prompt": "I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.", "completion": "I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control."}
{"prompt": "I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.", "completion": "I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more."}
{"prompt": "Gary, I --", "completion": "You see what's hanging on the wall?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.", "completion": "Oh, that's right. You're \"clueless.\""}
{"prompt": "I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.", "completion": "You could've handwritten it."}
{"prompt": "'Sorry about the late notice...", "completion": "\"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice...\"  You left my party to send E-mail?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.", "completion": "That's great! Thanks."}
{"prompt": "...Worse?", "completion": "Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  \"Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world.\" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one."}
{"prompt": "What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?", "completion": "No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse."}
{"prompt": "Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.", "completion": "...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a \"system.\" \"Losers,\" who played games of chance. He could \"read\" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again."}
{"prompt": "'Have a look?", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "You look a little tired.", "completion": "I'm okay. It's going well!"}
{"prompt": "The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.", "completion": "Gary, hi."}
{"prompt": "Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.", "completion": "The wrong place?"}
{"prompt": "Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...", "completion": "34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way."}
{"prompt": "You've been coming in early.", "completion": "It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her."}
{"prompt": "I meant did you find other stuff to --", "completion": "Oh. Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Did you?", "completion": "Talk about work? Never!"}
{"prompt": "Had you talked to him much lately?", "completion": "Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure."}
{"prompt": "I heard what happened.", "completion": "Were the flags for Teddy?"}
{"prompt": "It scales, don't you think?", "completion": "Definitely."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure.", "completion": "The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait."}
{"prompt": "Nothing!", "completion": "Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?"}
{"prompt": "You really wrote this just today?", "completion": "What're you implying."}
{"prompt": "Well -- you sent for me.", "completion": "Right... Right."}
{"prompt": "You're making me young again.", "completion": "Milo. What's up?"}
{"prompt": "Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.", "completion": "You did this -- overnight?"}
{"prompt": "Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --", "completion": "It's okay. Really."}
{"prompt": "How's it going?", "completion": "Maybe I'm going too fast."}
{"prompt": "Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.", "completion": "Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree."}
{"prompt": "That's insane. You're ahead of your time.", "completion": "That's what I told her. My wife."}
{"prompt": "...Do I?", "completion": "Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I'm Gary.", "completion": "'Think I should buy some originals?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.", "completion": "No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself."}
{"prompt": "When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --", "completion": "I do!"}
{"prompt": "It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?", "completion": "You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?"}
{"prompt": "Skywire.", "completion": "The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges."}
{"prompt": "Low enough to relay internet traffic.", "completion": "Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?"}
{"prompt": "There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.", "completion": "I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up."}
{"prompt": "Oh. No thanks.", "completion": "You know a lot about art, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Cool!", "completion": "Would you like a Coke or something?"}
{"prompt": "Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.", "completion": "You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up."}
{"prompt": "Just do it.", "completion": "...Hello?"}
{"prompt": "'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.", "completion": "Gary?"}

{"prompt": "Hasn't affected his work, though.", "completion": "Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me."}
{"prompt": "What'd the girl say?", "completion": "There may be a little less trust after your outburst."}
{"prompt": "'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.", "completion": "Maybe we should all get on it."}
{"prompt": "Cool.", "completion": "This is good. Who did it?"}
{"prompt": "Got out of my other commitment.", "completion": "You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?"}
{"prompt": "We'll come up with the next big thing.", "completion": "...You wanna work -- here?"}
{"prompt": "Those really weird, short lines.", "completion": "Your app kind of blew mine out of the water."}
{"prompt": "It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.", "completion": "Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style."}
{"prompt": "Just thought his work should go on.", "completion": "He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said \"The answer's not in the box, it's in the band.\" Know what it means?"}
{"prompt": "I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --", "completion": "You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you."}
{"prompt": "You do?", "completion": "I mean, it's your life."}
{"prompt": "In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.", "completion": "I think you should go."}
{"prompt": "I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.", "completion": "All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools."}
{"prompt": "Where we going?", "completion": "Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!"}
{"prompt": "I'm calling Gary.", "completion": "Come with me."}
{"prompt": "They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.", "completion": "You calling Phil and Randy?"}
{"prompt": "Let's get him in here.", "completion": "Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?"}
{"prompt": "Any irregularity in the pattern.", "completion": "Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time."}
{"prompt": "Keep looking.", "completion": "What're we looking for?"}
{"prompt": "Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.", "completion": "Every entry was authorized."}
{"prompt": "Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?", "completion": "Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?"}
{"prompt": "Latitude 47 degrees.", "completion": "Wait a second. He knows I know."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12."}
{"prompt": "Let's try #2.", "completion": "...He knows."}
{"prompt": "But you said the other --", "completion": "Maybe it's the satellite."}
{"prompt": "It's three years old, it --", "completion": "Bring it to the other location."}
{"prompt": "Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!", "completion": "They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?"}
{"prompt": "At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.", "completion": "Meet me at the other location."}
{"prompt": "She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.", "completion": "Please don't go."}
{"prompt": "He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.", "completion": "Why?!"}
{"prompt": "You'll come up with something.", "completion": "Does he know you know?"}
{"prompt": "You could always say you have to go the bathroom.", "completion": "That's lame, isn't it?"}

{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?"}
{"prompt": "Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?", "completion": "Yeah, that's old, in a tree."}
{"prompt": "They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.", "completion": "He doesn't know about the Day Care."}

{"prompt": "I felt guilty. 'Cause I \"owed so much\" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder.

{"prompt": "I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?", "completion": "Why were you snooping in my office?"}
{"prompt": "And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.", "completion": "Why were you so careless?"}
{"prompt": "You mean -- break in?", "completion": "I don't know --"}
{"prompt": "Before they kill somebody else, too.", "completion": "Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions."}
{"prompt": "It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.", "completion": "Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast."}
{"prompt": "But they'd still get the idea, right?", "completion": "You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?"}
{"prompt": "A what?", "completion": "It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away."}
{"prompt": "He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.", "completion": "We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet."}
{"prompt": "How close are you?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Time?", "completion": "Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  \"GE joins Outpost in new venture,\" which means NBC is out. \"Disney joins Outpost,\" ABC is out. \"Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,\" Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!"}
{"prompt": "But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --", "completion": "Say there's just one \"mole\" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?"}
{"prompt": "What about \"60 Minutes.\"", "completion": "Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  \"CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001.\""}
{"prompt": "Certainly not at my happy home.", "completion": "He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire."}
{"prompt": "Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.", "completion": "We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home."}
{"prompt": "There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.", "completion": "The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine."}
{"prompt": "There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.", "completion": "Do we post it on the Net?"}
{"prompt": "They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.", "completion": "Who can we trust?"}
{"prompt": "No, no. Never.", "completion": "What about the FBI?"}
{"prompt": "Hmm?", "completion": "I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean."}
{"prompt": "They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his \"act of revenge.\"", "completion": "...Milo?"}
{"prompt": "They'd frame him.", "completion": "He's out of prison?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah?", "completion": "Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me."}
{"prompt": "You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make \"sense.\" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.", "completion": "I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you."}
{"prompt": "It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.", "completion": "But why would they --?"}
{"prompt": "You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.", "completion": "The Day Care?"}
{"prompt": "I snuck into #21.", "completion": "Why would you do a thing like --"}
{"prompt": "That's great. I -- didn't know.", "completion": "She saved my life."}
{"prompt": "So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?", "completion": "Then and now.  But not right now."}
{"prompt": "Why's that?", "completion": "Long story. Not that interesting."}
{"prompt": "You're compulsive.", "completion": "Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people."}
{"prompt": "Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?", "completion": "Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway."}
{"prompt": "\"There is no second place.\" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?", "completion": "Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower."}
{"prompt": "No. Please.", "completion": "They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --", "completion": "Did you wanna be alone?"}
{"prompt": "Show me.", "completion": "Cool!"}
{"prompt": "What've you got there?", "completion": "Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you."}
{"prompt": "Did I say something?", "completion": "No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work."}
{"prompt": "...Something like that. Yeah.", "completion": "Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something."}
{"prompt": "We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.", "completion": "Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?"}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.", "completion": "...Were you?"}
{"prompt": "You're famous around here.", "completion": "I'm getting a teacher's pet rep."}
{"prompt": "You know my name.", "completion": "You know mine."}
{"prompt": "I didn't plan this.", "completion": "Lisa."}
{"prompt": "What does that mean?", "completion": "Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one."}
{"prompt": "What d'you mean?", "completion": "I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place."}
{"prompt": "No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.", "completion": "A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Did you tell Alice?"}
{"prompt": "I met this girl.", "completion": "What? Come on. Is it serious?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus, Teddy.", "completion": "I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers."}
{"prompt": "Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.", "completion": "But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week."}
{"prompt": "Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!", "completion": "We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms."}
{"prompt": "Uh. Not exactly.", "completion": "Wanted to say goodbye to him..."}
{"prompt": "And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.", "completion": "Is that how Larry feels?"}
{"prompt": "You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.", "completion": "...You got my E-mail?"}
{"prompt": "#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.", "completion": "Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites."}
{"prompt": "Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.", "completion": "What're they building?"}
{"prompt": "Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.", "completion": "I've got a girlfriend, remember?"}
{"prompt": "Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.", "completion": "She's a programmer?"}
{"prompt": "His Snapples were in alphabetical order.", "completion": "Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something."}
{"prompt": "Oh we're not going to the campus.", "completion": "So how'd you like the house?"}
{"prompt": "You don't look anything like a three- year-old.", "completion": "So -- how far are we from the campus?"}
{"prompt": "Did you download Corey? In San Jose?", "completion": "Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door."}
{"prompt": "Speaking of which...", "completion": "Yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt": "There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.", "completion": "Maybe he'll get back to work."}
{"prompt": "We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.", "completion": "Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?"}
{"prompt": "Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.", "completion": "We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?"}
{"prompt": "We're too late. Take a look.", "completion": "Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now."}
{"prompt": "Who're these guys?", "completion": "Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "I could get it out of him.", "completion": "You're not listening."}
{"prompt": "Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --", "completion": "That kid's the great white hope."}
{"prompt": "Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.", "completion": "There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.", "completion": "I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?"}
{"prompt": "Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?", "completion": "Is it about my teeth?"}
{"prompt": "To my health.", "completion": "Kiss me."}
{"prompt": "'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'", "completion": "Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health."}
{"prompt": "'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'", "completion": "That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?"}
{"prompt": "How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?", "completion": "Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Care for some saki?", "completion": "Sak-i it to me!"}
{"prompt": "In Japan, men come first and women come second.", "completion": "Or sometimes not at all."}
{"prompt": "May I wash you?", "completion": "Groovy."}
{"prompt": "I'd rather talk about Number Two.", "completion": "Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know."}
{"prompt": "Behave!", "completion": "Come in."}
{"prompt": "I didn't, baby, you just told me.", "completion": "It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.", "completion": "Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?"}
{"prompt": "Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?", "completion": "You may."}
{"prompt": "What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?", "completion": "What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?"}
{"prompt": "You seem surprised to see me.", "completion": "I thought you'd quit while you were ahead."}
{"prompt": "\"Fifteen minutes of fame?\" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.", "completion": "Smashing!"}
{"prompt": "I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.", "completion": "If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man."}
{"prompt": "Hungry.", "completion": "Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup."}
{"prompt": "Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.", "completion": "Hey, how are you?"}
{"prompt": "Yes Basil?", "completion": "Be careful!"}
{"prompt": "Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.", "completion": "But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--"}
{"prompt": "Austin, I have something for you as well.", "completion": "Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you."}
{"prompt": "Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.", "completion": "Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!"}
{"prompt": "Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.", "completion": "I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition."}
{"prompt": "Be careful.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?", "completion": "Yes, Basil?"}
{"prompt": "All right, Austin, I think you should go.", "completion": "I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag."}
{"prompt": "Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!", "completion": "You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick."}
{"prompt": "That's not your mother, that's a man!", "completion": "I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man."}
{"prompt": "Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.", "completion": "My God, Austin, what have you done?"}
{"prompt": "Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.", "completion": "Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage."}
{"prompt": "What's the other thing you're scared of?", "completion": "Carnies."}
{"prompt": "What's the other?", "completion": "Excuse me?"}
{"prompt": "Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.", "completion": "Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Hello, Exposition."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Be careful."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. Thank you.", "completion": "There's one more thing, Austin."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Basil.", "completion": "Oh, and Austin..."}
{"prompt": "She's working on another lead right now.", "completion": "Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck."}
{"prompt": "Right away, Exposition.", "completion": "Where is Vanessa, by the way?"}
{"prompt": "Be careful.", "completion": "Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately."}
{"prompt": "Oh, and Austin...", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.", "completion": "Thank you, Exposition."}
{"prompt": "Be careful.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Oh, and Austin...", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.", "completion": "Thank you, Exposition."}
{"prompt": "Vanessa's one of our top agents.", "completion": "My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now."}
{"prompt": "You mean Mrs. Kensington?", "completion": "No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter."}
{"prompt": "When do I begin?", "completion": "Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington."}
{"prompt": "We won, Austin.", "completion": "Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!"}
{"prompt": "A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.", "completion": "Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?"}
{"prompt": "You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.", "completion": "Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?"}
{"prompt": "The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.", "completion": "Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!"}
{"prompt": "You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.", "completion": "WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  Let's go, baby!", "completion": "Where am I?"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Be careful."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Oh, and Austin..."}
{"prompt": "Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.", "completion": "Good luck, Austin."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.", "completion": "I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London."}
{"prompt": "We know all that, Exposition.", "completion": "I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world."}
{"prompt": "Groovy!", "completion": "Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone."}
{"prompt": "\"You can't always get what you want!\" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.", "completion": "Good on ya, man."}
{"prompt": "Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?", "completion": "Well, you can't always get what you want."}
{"prompt": "Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.", "completion": "Hey, Mick!"}
{"prompt": "Why not? It's a question.", "completion": "Love is... love is... love is..."}
{"prompt": "Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?", "completion": "That does not compute."}
{"prompt": "Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.", "completion": "Yes, I am programmed to answer any question."}
{"prompt": "Man, you are one chilly square!", "completion": "Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to..."}
{"prompt": "It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.", "completion": "Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care."}
{"prompt": "That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.", "completion": "Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster."}
{"prompt": "No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.", "completion": "Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed."}
{"prompt": "I've got you, Dr. Evil!", "completion": "Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?", "completion": "No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.", "completion": "Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act."}
{"prompt": "What's wrong with your hand?", "completion": "Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless."}
{"prompt": "Kiss me.", "completion": "Behave!"}
{"prompt": "I love you, Austin.", "completion": "That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa."}
{"prompt": "I have something to tell you.", "completion": "Lay it on me."}
{"prompt": "I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.", "completion": "I'll secure the perimeter."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry!", "completion": "Austin, I'm coming with you."}
{"prompt": "Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!", "completion": "Are you crazy?"}
{"prompt": "I believe you, Austin. Let's go.", "completion": "Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs."}
{"prompt": "Likewise.", "completion": "I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, behave!", "completion": "It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys."}
{"prompt": "Austin, what's your point?", "completion": "Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you."}
{"prompt": "I'll hurry back.", "completion": "Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--"}
{"prompt": "I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.", "completion": "Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops."}
{"prompt": "What do we do now?", "completion": "We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor."}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Fair enough."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong."}
{"prompt": "Indeed.", "completion": "That's not the way to get ahead in life."}
{"prompt": "Smashing idea! Give it to me.", "completion": "Not a good time to lose one's head."}
{"prompt": "All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.", "completion": "No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge."}
{"prompt": "First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?", "completion": "Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case."}
{"prompt": "Does that make you horny?", "completion": "Not now, Austin."}
{"prompt": "Thank God, Austin, we made it.", "completion": "Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa."}
{"prompt": "Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.", "completion": "Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now."}
{"prompt": "No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.", "completion": "I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "You know who."}
{"prompt": "Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?", "completion": "Do you think she's prettier than I?"}
{"prompt": "Out and about, doing odds and sods.", "completion": "I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.", "completion": "Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night."}
{"prompt": "Hello, luv.", "completion": "Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang."}
{"prompt": "It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.", "completion": "You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely."}
{"prompt": "Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.", "completion": "Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man."}
{"prompt": "Only sailors use condoms, man.", "completion": "Not in the Nineties."}
{"prompt": "Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.", "completion": "No, did you use a condom?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.", "completion": "I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?"}
{"prompt": "Of course, luv.", "completion": "Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.", "completion": "Austin, may I have a word with you?"}
{"prompt": "She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.", "completion": "Really, Austin!"}
{"prompt": "I can't. You're drunk.", "completion": "It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes you are.", "completion": "I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver."}
{"prompt": "You're smashed, Vanessa.", "completion": "I am not."}
{"prompt": "Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.", "completion": "No, this is me in a nutshell."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die."}
{"prompt": "I haven't had fun like that since college.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.", "completion": "Go! Just go!"}
{"prompt": "I couldn't have another bite.", "completion": "Watch out, you're on my hair!"}
{"prompt": "You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.", "completion": "Fancy a nibble?"}
{"prompt": "No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...", "completion": "I hate having my picture taken."}
{"prompt": "Well, you know... cows, and shagging.", "completion": "Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped."}
{"prompt": "Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'", "completion": "I don't get it."}
{"prompt": "He's too well-protected right now.", "completion": "We can't just sit here, Austin."}
{"prompt": "I never forget a pussy... cat.", "completion": "Let's go get him!"}
{"prompt": "Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.", "completion": "How do you know?"}
{"prompt": "A limousine has just pulled up.", "completion": "Let me see."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to talk to him?", "completion": "Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear."}
{"prompt": "That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.", "completion": "Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.", "completion": "Why did you leave so soon?"}
{"prompt": "I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.", "completion": "I can't see a bloody thing."}
{"prompt": "I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.", "completion": "Here, use mine."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure.", "completion": "I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling."}
{"prompt": "Why? What's wrong with my teeth?", "completion": "Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine."}
{"prompt": "Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.", "completion": "No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry."}
{"prompt": "You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!", "completion": "Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this."}
{"prompt": "Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.", "completion": "I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you."}
{"prompt": "Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?", "completion": "I hope this is part of the unfreezing process."}
{"prompt": "Do I make you horny?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.", "completion": "That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!"}
{"prompt": "A Chigro?", "completion": "You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.", "completion": "Have you ever made love to a Chigro?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry?", "completion": "My meat and two veg."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me?", "completion": "My wedding tackle."}
{"prompt": "I beg your pardon?", "completion": "I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working."}
{"prompt": "I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...", "completion": "That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?"}
{"prompt": "My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.", "completion": "Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?"}
{"prompt": "OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.", "completion": "Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport."}
{"prompt": "If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?", "completion": "My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.", "completion": "My mother's told me all about you."}
{"prompt": "One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.", "completion": "Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967."}
{"prompt": "One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.", "completion": "I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby."}
{"prompt": "One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.", "completion": "I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine."}
{"prompt": "OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.", "completion": "That's not mine."}
{"prompt": "It says here, name Danger Powers.", "completion": "Danger's my middle name."}
{"prompt": "Danger Powers, personal effects.", "completion": "Actually, my name's Austin Powers."}
{"prompt": "Noooooooooooooo!", "completion": "Where did you learn to shoot?"}
{"prompt": "No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.", "completion": "I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert."}
{"prompt": "Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.", "completion": "No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece."}
{"prompt": "Here, have a piece of gum.", "completion": "Don't mind if I do."}
{"prompt": "Hey, wait a minute--", "completion": "Here, have a piece of gum."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Everything seems to be in order."}
{"prompt": "That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!", "completion": "Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?"}
{"prompt": "What's its current position?", "completion": "Commander, I have to log it..."}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?"}
{"prompt": "Oh my God, he's back.", "completion": "In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices."}
{"prompt": "What are you saying, son?", "completion": "It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir."}
{"prompt": "Is it one of ours?", "completion": "No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir."}
{"prompt": "You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--", "completion": "Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle."}
{"prompt": "Ow! You shot me!", "completion": "Right. Okay. Moving on."}
{"prompt": "Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.", "completion": "You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me."}
{"prompt": "Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.", "completion": "Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time."}
{"prompt": "Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.", "completion": "We've got a lot of work to do."}
{"prompt": "Silence!", "completion": "Ahhhhhhhhh!"}
{"prompt": "And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!", "completion": "We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;"}
{"prompt": "Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!", "completion": "But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm..."}
{"prompt": "Please allow me to demonstrate.", "completion": "But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left."}
{"prompt": "They're mutated sea bass.", "completion": "Really? Are they ill-tempered?"}
{"prompt": "Sea bass.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.", "completion": "I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?"}
{"prompt": "Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.", "completion": "What is it now?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.", "completion": "It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape."}
{"prompt": "Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.", "completion": "Dr. Evil?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Herr Doctor.", "completion": "I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it."}
{"prompt": "These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!", "completion": "Quite impressive."}
{"prompt": "Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!", "completion": "Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers."}
{"prompt": "Yes.  Scott!", "completion": "Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?"}
{"prompt": "Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.", "completion": "My son?"}
{"prompt": "Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "The details of my life are quite inconsequential.", "completion": "That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood."}
{"prompt": "Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.", "completion": "We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you."}
{"prompt": "No, the boy's right. I really am evil.", "completion": "Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."}
{"prompt": "That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?", "completion": "Evil, actually, Doctor Evil."}
{"prompt": "I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.", "completion": "Scott, don't say that..."}
{"prompt": "Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!", "completion": "I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent."}
{"prompt": "What did you say?", "completion": "Show me."}
{"prompt": "Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?", "completion": "Blow me."}
{"prompt": "Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?", "completion": "I don't want to."}
{"prompt": "I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.", "completion": "No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?"}
{"prompt": "Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!", "completion": "No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan."}
{"prompt": "One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.", "completion": "Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank."}
{"prompt": "I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.", "completion": "Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done."}
{"prompt": "In due time.", "completion": "But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?"}
{"prompt": "Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.", "completion": "Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?"}
{"prompt": "And that's how you want to live your life, is it?", "completion": "Yeah. What?"}
{"prompt": "Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?", "completion": "Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax."}
{"prompt": "Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?", "completion": "Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'."}
{"prompt": "An evil petting zoo?", "completion": "You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil."}
{"prompt": "An evil vet?", "completion": "No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something."}
{"prompt": "But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?", "completion": "Not me."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.", "completion": "I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!", "completion": "Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year."}
{"prompt": "Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!", "completion": "Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days."}
{"prompt": "People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a \"laser.\"  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the \"Ozone Layer.\" Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.", "completion": "Umm, that also has already happened."}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.", "completion": "Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually."}
{"prompt": "I love you, Vanessa.", "completion": "We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved."}
{"prompt": "No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.", "completion": "I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you."}
{"prompt": "You didn't answer my question, Mum.", "completion": "I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had."}
{"prompt": "Did you ever want to?", "completion": "Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery."}
{"prompt": "Did you ever...", "completion": "Of course not. I was married to your father."}
{"prompt": "I just don't see it.", "completion": "Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out."}
{"prompt": "What about his teeth?", "completion": "You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter."}
{"prompt": "Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.", "completion": "You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms."}
{"prompt": "Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.", "completion": "I'm proud of you."}
{"prompt": "He's asleep.", "completion": "You didn't..."}
{"prompt": "Great.", "completion": "How's Austin?"}
{"prompt": "OK, Scott, no one really wants to \"kill\" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.", "completion": "Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?"}
{"prompt": "Scott.", "completion": "I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me."}
{"prompt": "We don't label people here, Scott.", "completion": "No, he's really evil."}
{"prompt": "What do you want to do, Scott?", "completion": "I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff."}
{"prompt": "And how do you feel about that?", "completion": "I don't wanna take over the family business."}
{"prompt": "We don't judge here.", "completion": "OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business."}
{"prompt": "So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?", "completion": "Well, it's kind of weird."}
{"prompt": "The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.", "completion": "No need. I'll call again."}
{"prompt": "As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.", "completion": "There are limits?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.", "completion": "You don't say. How real does it feel?"}
{"prompt": "Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --", "completion": "Seriously?"}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?"}
{"prompt": "We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.", "completion": "Shame. I was recommended. By a friend."}
{"prompt": "Would that I could say the Same.", "completion": "Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ..."}
{"prompt": "He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.", "completion": "So I'm still ..."}
{"prompt": "How long have I been here?", "completion": "Three days."}
{"prompt": "... love ...", "completion": "Peter ..."}
{"prompt": "... love ...", "completion": "Fear ..."}
{"prompt": "... love...", "completion": "Hope..."}

{"prompt": "Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!", "completion": "Sir August...?  What now?"}
{"prompt": "Promised? Who promised?", "completion": "There, look!"}
{"prompt": "You mean you don't recall??", "completion": "Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised."}
{"prompt": "You", "completion": "Have we met?"}
{"prompt": "I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?", "completion": "Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ..."}
{"prompt": "I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --", "completion": "You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man."}
{"prompt": "No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.", "completion": "Really -- what happened in 1922?"}
{"prompt": "Then you can't come in.", "completion": "I have an appointment."}
{"prompt": "You are female?", "completion": "As you see."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid that's impossible.", "completion": "Impossible?"}
{"prompt": "May I help you, madam ...", "completion": "Mr. John Steed, please."}
{"prompt": "Then who wins?", "completion": "You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ..."}
{"prompt": "Rules are made to be broken.", "completion": "People, too."}
{"prompt": "This isn't a game.", "completion": "Quite right, but we still make the rules."}
{"prompt": "We have met ...", "completion": "Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning."}
{"prompt": "If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.", "completion": "Your voice -- it's so familiar ..."}
{"prompt": "Eh? In here!", "completion": "Quite a collection."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Steed.", "completion": "Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?"}
{"prompt": "Next assignment?", "completion": "Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ..."}
{"prompt": "So am I.", "completion": "About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ..."}
{"prompt": "To find out who killed my husband.", "completion": "The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment."}
{"prompt": "Quite frankly ... it could have been you.", "completion": "This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.", "completion": "The Institute ... the funding ..."}
{"prompt": "The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...", "completion": "To you ... ?"}
{"prompt": "We want to help...!", "completion": "I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that."}
{"prompt": "Watch me.", "completion": "What are you trying to do to me?"}
{"prompt": "I resign.", "completion": "You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign."}
{"prompt": "London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.", "completion": "After the cold war ..."}
{"prompt": "Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?", "completion": "Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible."}
{"prompt": "Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.", "completion": "He tried to warn us ..."}
{"prompt": "Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.", "completion": "Ropes?"}
{"prompt": "How curious ...", "completion": "Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out."}

{"prompt": "Hmmm ...", "completion": "Looks like rain, Steed..."}
{"prompt": "I'll never marry you.", "completion": "Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ..."}
{"prompt": "What are my choices?", "completion": "Choices?"}
{"prompt": "How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.", "completion": "Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel."}
{"prompt": "One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.", "completion": "The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete."}
{"prompt": "Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...", "completion": "Then what's stopping you?"}
{"prompt": "Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.", "completion": "The result would be ..."}
{"prompt": "Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --", "completion": "Such as?"}
{"prompt": "That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...", "completion": "You're mad."}
{"prompt": "Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.", "completion": "Ring?"}
{"prompt": "You know, I believe she's actually jealous.", "completion": "Valentine, listen to me ..."}
{"prompt": "I'm already married ...", "completion": "Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...", "completion": "Think of this as your second wedding feast ..."}
{"prompt": "You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...", "completion": "'Our revels now are ended.'"}
{"prompt": "Of course. I planned that, too.", "completion": "But -- why?"}
{"prompt": "Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...", "completion": "But I found you. All the clues led me here ..."}
{"prompt": "For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...", "completion": "Too many cooks --"}
{"prompt": "An unholy trinity ...", "completion": "You killed my husband."}
{"prompt": "A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...", "completion": "Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ..."}
{"prompt": "You.", "completion": "Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ..."}
{"prompt": "Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.", "completion": "Thanks, Valentine ..."}
{"prompt": "Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?", "completion": "Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ..."}
{"prompt": "Our chaperon.", "completion": "Pity your mother came, too ..."}
{"prompt": "Our little paradise -- just made for two?", "completion": "Not quite."}
{"prompt": "I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.", "completion": "It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel."}
{"prompt": "Have you any place in mind?", "completion": "As a matter of fact I have ..."}
{"prompt": "Still a bit chilly ...", "completion": "English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ..."}
{"prompt": "'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'", "completion": "A fine night, Mrs. Peel ..."}
{"prompt": "The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...", "completion": "'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Peel?", "completion": "What kept you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.", "completion": "If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --"}
{"prompt": "No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.", "completion": "But --"}
{"prompt": "Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...", "completion": "You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect."}
{"prompt": "I'll be back ...", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?", "completion": "Have a look at this."}
{"prompt": "They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.", "completion": "'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?"}
{"prompt": "Trubshaw again? What now?", "completion": "Snuff.  I must insist you try some."}
{"prompt": "You first.", "completion": "Shall we?"}
{"prompt": "Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.", "completion": "When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit."}
{"prompt": "Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "What's that you're wearing?", "completion": "It's called Black Leather."}
{"prompt": "There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.", "completion": "Have we been invited?"}
{"prompt": "Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --", "completion": "You didn't tell her?"}
{"prompt": "I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.", "completion": "We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ..."}
{"prompt": "You'll find out.", "completion": "Aren't you coming?"}
{"prompt": "His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.", "completion": "Why's he called 'Invisible'?"}
{"prompt": "Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.", "completion": "I'm a wanted woman, I know ..."}
{"prompt": "Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?", "completion": "Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody."}
{"prompt": "Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...", "completion": "... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children."}
{"prompt": "Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?", "completion": "No idea who. No idea why ..."}
{"prompt": "You lied.", "completion": "I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ..."}
{"prompt": "As far as you trust me.", "completion": "I told Mother I took care of you."}
{"prompt": "No, after you.", "completion": "You don't trust me?"}
{"prompt": "Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.", "completion": "After you -- Mrs. Peel ..."}
{"prompt": "I'm playing to win.", "completion": "Winning isn't everything."}
{"prompt": "I thought you played by the rules.", "completion": "I thought you didn't."}
{"prompt": "You're playing games.", "completion": "Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?"}
{"prompt": "But you did suspect me.", "completion": "Not for a moment."}
{"prompt": "Keeping a stiff upper lip?", "completion": "Is that all?"}
{"prompt": "It wasn't me; you have my word.", "completion": "Mmm ... what are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "And do you trust me?", "completion": "I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ..."}
{"prompt": "Yes ... ?", "completion": "... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust."}
{"prompt": "Because you always obey orders ...", "completion": "Always.  Except ..."}
{"prompt": "I could save you the trouble.", "completion": "No trouble."}
{"prompt": "To kill me?", "completion": "Nothing personal."}
{"prompt": "You followed me.", "completion": "Orders."}
{"prompt": "I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...", "completion": "It was Peter -- I saw him ..."}
{"prompt": "The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...", "completion": "Was I?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Peel ... ?", "completion": "Where am I?"}
{"prompt": "I expect we'll have to gatecrash.", "completion": "Steed ... !"}
{"prompt": "Here's the one that broke the camel's back.", "completion": "Someone didn't want us to get to the party."}
{"prompt": "You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?", "completion": "This must be the last straw."}
{"prompt": "What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?", "completion": "Barely."}
{"prompt": "Do you always drive this fast?", "completion": "Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ..."}
{"prompt": "Is that what you think?", "completion": "Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel."}
{"prompt": "Not that I know of.  Explanation?", "completion": "According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D."}
{"prompt": "Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...", "completion": "... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?"}
{"prompt": "Three agents killed by bad weather...", "completion": "... And by you, Mrs. Peel ..."}
{"prompt": "That's what we were working on.", "completion": "Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research."}
{"prompt": "Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...", "completion": "But if someone miniaturized the process..."}
{"prompt": "The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...", "completion": "Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?"}
{"prompt": "Not quite. This is my field.", "completion": "Is there anything that isn't?"}
{"prompt": "But", "completion": "Don't bother.  Here's a bus ..."}
{"prompt": "For you, Mrs. Peel.", "completion": "Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?"}
{"prompt": "Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...", "completion": "She had this in her mouth. There, there..."}
{"prompt": "Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...", "completion": "Is that written in his shoe?"}
{"prompt": "What on earth?", "completion": "Any ideas?"}
{"prompt": "Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...", "completion": "Very good, Steed ..."}
{"prompt": "Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.", "completion": "How on earth can you tell?"}
{"prompt": "Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?", "completion": "I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning."}
{"prompt": "I must say, you look more your old self --", "completion": "You mean my other self ..."}
{"prompt": "An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?", "completion": "Did you say formal? I must dress."}
{"prompt": "Did he say who?", "completion": "No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.", "completion": "That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised."}
{"prompt": "Frankly that's how I remember it.", "completion": "But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style."}
{"prompt": "Why should they think that?", "completion": "You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead."}
{"prompt": "I might say the same.", "completion": "Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you."}
{"prompt": "I wasn't about to.", "completion": "I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed."}
{"prompt": "Strange.", "completion": "You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank."}
{"prompt": "Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?", "completion": "You should be dead.  How do you feel?"}
{"prompt": "So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?", "completion": "Small talk.  Try the weather."}
{"prompt": "Any other vices?", "completion": "All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens."}
{"prompt": "June, July ... August?", "completion": "The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined."}
{"prompt": "An eccentric recluse?", "completion": "Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie."}
{"prompt": "I meant me.", "completion": "According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ..."}
{"prompt": "After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?", "completion": "No thanks."}
{"prompt": "They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.", "completion": "I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?"}
{"prompt": "For a man in my position --", "completion": "Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?"}
{"prompt": "As per mother's instructions.", "completion": "Do we always follow Mother's instructions?"}
{"prompt": "That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.", "completion": "Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?"}
{"prompt": "And I suppose you're the knight.", "completion": "The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen."}
{"prompt": "But why? What's the point?", "completion": "A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor."}
{"prompt": "You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?", "completion": "Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you."}
{"prompt": "That place is so absurd, so out of date ...", "completion": "Do you really think so?"}
{"prompt": "You can but I wish you wouldn't ...", "completion": "Thank you, Trubshaw ..."}
{"prompt": "Steed, we really must be --", "completion": "Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.", "completion": "Or half cocked."}
{"prompt": "Yes indeed. I need protection.", "completion": "I thought we were on our way."}
{"prompt": "I had a feeling you would. Touche!", "completion": "Do you?"}
{"prompt": "My father always wanted a boy.", "completion": "Really?  I fail to see the connection."}
{"prompt": "Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.", "completion": "A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?"}
{"prompt": "... Showers followed by sunny periods.", "completion": "We're not here to talk about the weather, surely."}
{"prompt": "I didn't. Mother did.", "completion": "Mother?"}
{"prompt": "Much better.", "completion": "And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?"}
{"prompt": "I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?", "completion": "Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel."}
{"prompt": "Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.", "completion": "And just what is the game?"}
{"prompt": "Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.", "completion": "Rules are made to be broken."}
{"prompt": "Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.", "completion": "Whereas you are."}
{"prompt": "Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?", "completion": "So what was all this -- some sort of test?"}
{"prompt": "I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --", "completion": "1922. Why the kippers?"}
{"prompt": "I was about to throw in the towel.", "completion": "I had a spot of bother at the door."}
{"prompt": "Doctor Peel, I presume?", "completion": "And you must be Steed. Please don't get up."}
{"prompt": "Decontamination -- ?", "completion": "And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful."}
{"prompt": "It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.", "completion": "Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete."}
{"prompt": "Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...", "completion": "You don't believe him?"}
{"prompt": "You're saying I have no choice.", "completion": "Where's Mother?"}
{"prompt": "I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?", "completion": "Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?", "completion": "Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died."}
{"prompt": "I shall need a small plane.", "completion": "You're not venturing alone, surely."}
{"prompt": "Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.", "completion": "Very good, Mrs. Peel ..."}
{"prompt": "... and now?", "completion": "Privately owned by ..."}
{"prompt": "Well, I can't possibly go like this.", "completion": "'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation..."}
{"prompt": "I fail to see --", "completion": "Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ..."}
{"prompt": "Getting to what?", "completion": "The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --"}
{"prompt": "Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.", "completion": "I was getting to it."}
{"prompt": "Who's now vanished.", "completion": "Makes two of us."}
{"prompt": "Surveillance? By whom?", "completion": "Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling."}
{"prompt": "I know all this.", "completion": "Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?"}
{"prompt": "Half-brother to be precise.", "completion": "Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ..."}
{"prompt": "Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.", "completion": "Peter's brother?  But --"}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...", "completion": "Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal."}
{"prompt": "It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.", "completion": "Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'"}
{"prompt": "How did you guess?", "completion": "You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ..."}
{"prompt": "Dead, I'm afraid.", "completion": "Steed"}
{"prompt": "Oh, hello ...", "completion": "We want Mrs. Peel."}
{"prompt": "We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.", "completion": "So you say ..."}
{"prompt": "Global warming?", "completion": "Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?"}
{"prompt": "I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.", "completion": "A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ..."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "In your operation."}
{"prompt": "You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.", "completion": "I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole."}
{"prompt": "Mother and Father know best.", "completion": "I was hoping you could tell me."}
{"prompt": "Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --", "completion": "Guilty until proven innocent?"}
{"prompt": "You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?", "completion": "Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ..."}
{"prompt": "This man -- did you see him?", "completion": "No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all."}
{"prompt": "Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.", "completion": "Impossible."}
{"prompt": "You.", "completion": "We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ..."}
{"prompt": "Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.", "completion": "Anyone particular in mind?"}
{"prompt": "Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.", "completion": "How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "She may try to kill you."}
{"prompt": "Insane ... ?", "completion": "Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out."}
{"prompt": "Amnesia?", "completion": "Possibly. Split personality ..."}
{"prompt": "Think she really killed those agents?", "completion": "She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill."}
{"prompt": "Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.", "completion": "Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --"}
{"prompt": "You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.", "completion": "Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her."}
{"prompt": "Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.", "completion": "Weather's turning nasty."}
{"prompt": "This way ...", "completion": "Mother. I thought you were burglars."}
{"prompt": "You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...", "completion": "Wonderland Weather Ltd."}
{"prompt": "Both, actually.", "completion": "Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry."}
{"prompt": "She was ...", "completion": "You with Mother or Father?"}
{"prompt": "I feel sure of it.", "completion": "I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?"}
{"prompt": "I think so, thank you so much ...", "completion": "Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy."}
{"prompt": "Stay by the window. By the window.", "completion": "Are you alright, young man?"}
{"prompt": "Walk over to the window ...", "completion": "Let it be rain, please let it be --"}
{"prompt": "Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...", "completion": "No, please! I beg you ..."}
{"prompt": "Ugh ...", "completion": "Mrs. Peel -- ?"}
{"prompt": "Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --", "completion": "I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?"}
{"prompt": "Aren't you forgetting about something?", "completion": "You are, and it's behind you."}
{"prompt": "You said ... one shot.", "completion": "Did I? My mistake."}
{"prompt": "If you say so.", "completion": "I do."}
{"prompt": "That's not playing by the rules.", "completion": "Rules are made to be broken."}
{"prompt": "You wish.", "completion": "One shot -- for emergencies."}
{"prompt": "But did they teach you this?", "completion": "Bang-bang ... you're dead."}
{"prompt": "You're better than I expected.", "completion": "I was at Harrow ..."}
{"prompt": "The last one you'll ever see.", "completion": "Perish the thought."}
{"prompt": "John Steed.", "completion": "Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face."}
{"prompt": "Look at that guy. What a hunk.", "completion": "Check out the other guy's buns."}
{"prompt": "I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.", "completion": "Deb, I want to throw you a shower."}
{"prompt": "Does Cole know about this?", "completion": "Really -- you went with him for two years."}
{"prompt": "Debbie's marrying Rick.", "completion": "...Really?"}
{"prompt": "Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.", "completion": "What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "I feel like I'm spying on Rick.", "completion": "Deb, we're pretending to be hookers."}
{"prompt": "Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.", "completion": "That's what we're going to find out..."}
{"prompt": "I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.", "completion": "You're kidding."}
{"prompt": "They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.", "completion": "What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?"}
{"prompt": "He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.", "completion": "He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either."}
{"prompt": "Bobbie, what are you talking about?", "completion": "O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it."}
{"prompt": "Women!", "completion": "Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited."}
{"prompt": "Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.", "completion": "I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes."}
{"prompt": "Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.", "completion": "Chulo, one thing at a time."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.", "completion": "Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You're kidding."}
{"prompt": "Rick's got an important announcement to make.", "completion": "Yeah. What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, man, congratulations!", "completion": "I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?"}
{"prompt": "Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.", "completion": "Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro."}
{"prompt": "Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.", "completion": "Man, you're losing your audience."}
{"prompt": "Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?", "completion": "I've decided not to run for President."}
{"prompt": "Hey, you guys, what's going on?", "completion": "We're going for a little liquid refreshment."}
{"prompt": "Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.", "completion": "I'd like to jerk and press those babies."}
{"prompt": "All right!", "completion": "When do the girls get to the party?"}
{"prompt": "I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.", "completion": "What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?"}
{"prompt": "You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?", "completion": "Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks."}
{"prompt": "He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: \"24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!\" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.", "completion": "Fan out and look for them."}
{"prompt": "Cole, what the hell are you doing?", "completion": "She's mine!"}
{"prompt": "Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?", "completion": "You've had it. I'm gonna get you."}
{"prompt": "Shit!", "completion": "Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be."}
{"prompt": "Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!", "completion": "Maybe it had something to do."}
{"prompt": "Low mileage... Handles like a dream.", "completion": "So does Debbie."}
{"prompt": "I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.", "completion": "Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?"}
{"prompt": "I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.", "completion": "The car for Debbie?"}
{"prompt": "I love that car.", "completion": "I'm very happy for you two."}
{"prompt": "Great car.", "completion": "The best."}
{"prompt": "Ooh, be still, my heart.", "completion": "See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche."}
{"prompt": "Oh, come on, just a little.", "completion": "I'm ready to make you another deal."}
{"prompt": "Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.", "completion": "I don't want any trouble."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.", "completion": "Rick, I want to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.", "completion": "He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would."}
{"prompt": "Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...", "completion": "What is this person's story here?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...", "completion": "I'm marrying Debbie."}
{"prompt": "Seventy-five hundred.", "completion": "Not interested."}
{"prompt": "Five thousand dollars.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "You dump her and I'll give you cash.", "completion": "What's Debbie's blue book value right now?"}
{"prompt": "I want Debbie.", "completion": "Cole..."}
{"prompt": "Bond... James Bond.", "completion": "Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?"}
{"prompt": "Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...", "completion": "And..."}
{"prompt": "Yes I did.", "completion": "Fine. How's everything going?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Thomerson.", "completion": "Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Hello?"}
{"prompt": "1002.", "completion": "All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes."}
{"prompt": "The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...", "completion": "Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.", "completion": "Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Well, tell the asshole to shut up.", "completion": "Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir."}
{"prompt": "What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.", "completion": "Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise."}
{"prompt": "Keep me informed.", "completion": "So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?"}
{"prompt": "If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.", "completion": "Thanks for the advise, sir."}
{"prompt": "It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.", "completion": "But how can I do that?"}
{"prompt": "Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.", "completion": "I've tried to change her mind."}
{"prompt": "I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.", "completion": "Yes, sir, I am."}
{"prompt": "Nice shot.", "completion": "Thank you, sir."}
{"prompt": "So, Cole, you been practicing your game?", "completion": "Sure have..."}
{"prompt": "Hi, everybody. Am I late?", "completion": "Not at all. We're just finishing lunch."}
{"prompt": "I'm going now, Cole.", "completion": "I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy."}
{"prompt": "Cole, I'm sorry, I...", "completion": "That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me."}
{"prompt": "I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.", "completion": "You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy."}
{"prompt": "Cole, I'm marrying Rick.", "completion": "You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?"}
{"prompt": "Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...", "completion": "You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough..."}
{"prompt": "No, Cole, I...", "completion": "It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas."}
{"prompt": "Cole, we've got to talk.", "completion": "Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Cole?", "completion": "Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse."}
{"prompt": "This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?", "completion": "You're so romantic..."}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Let's get naked.", "completion": "You're on."}
{"prompt": "Yes...", "completion": "Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?"}
{"prompt": "You don't believe me? Okay, fine.", "completion": "See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?"}
{"prompt": "I am committed. I love you.", "completion": "I don't believe you."}
{"prompt": "I don't want that. I want to be with you.", "completion": "And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment."}
{"prompt": "Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.", "completion": "The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life."}
{"prompt": "Rick, you're lying!", "completion": "Let go of me!"}
{"prompt": "I can't trust you!", "completion": "C'mon, I knew it was you."}
{"prompt": "How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.", "completion": "Why don't you get undressed."}
{"prompt": "I love you.", "completion": "Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around."}
{"prompt": "Have a good time. Don't make it too late.", "completion": "Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap."}
{"prompt": "Your mother's not dead.", "completion": "Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her."}
{"prompt": "You're really pissing me off.", "completion": "Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave."}
{"prompt": "Remember, you promised... no screwing around.", "completion": "Did I promise that? I don't remember that..."}
{"prompt": "Can't I just go with you guys?", "completion": "Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady."}
{"prompt": "Gonna get married...", "completion": "This is it, lady. Last stop."}
{"prompt": "You better not have too much joy.", "completion": "Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're..."}
{"prompt": "Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.", "completion": "Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness."}
{"prompt": "Good...", "completion": "Um... that's very relaxing."}
{"prompt": "C'mere.", "completion": "That feels so great."}
{"prompt": "I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.", "completion": "Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?"}
{"prompt": "About what?", "completion": "The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party..."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter?", "completion": "I don't know... I just feel scared."}
{"prompt": "Oh... I got something for that.", "completion": "Stop fooling around... I need to talk."}
{"prompt": "Huh? Wha...", "completion": "I can't sleep."}
{"prompt": "Oh, those. Why do you ask?", "completion": "Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy."}
{"prompt": "No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.", "completion": "I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.", "completion": "Are you going to have women at your party?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?", "completion": "It looks awful."}
{"prompt": "Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.", "completion": "You're going to have a bachelor party?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.", "completion": "Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun."}
{"prompt": "It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.", "completion": "I think your dinner's burning."}
{"prompt": "But a fabulous cook.", "completion": "What are we having?"}
{"prompt": "I know what I'm doing... Go!", "completion": "God, you're a slob."}
{"prompt": "Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!", "completion": "Ilene, are you crazy?"}
{"prompt": "Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.", "completion": "Let's go."}
{"prompt": "Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.", "completion": "That doesn't mean it was Rick's party."}
{"prompt": "Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.", "completion": "Are you sure this is a good idea?"}
{"prompt": "Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?", "completion": "Ilene, Rick promised..."}
{"prompt": "If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.", "completion": "Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick."}
{"prompt": "I hope Ilene's all right.", "completion": "I hope those guys are all right."}
{"prompt": "What kind of job? I'm a housewife.", "completion": "Quiet, Mother."}
{"prompt": "A strange wang right in my palm.", "completion": "Ilene, we don't really know that."}
{"prompt": "Why is Cole here?", "completion": "You know your father enjoys his company."}
{"prompt": "I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.", "completion": "Great, Mom."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.", "completion": "Any time, Al."}
{"prompt": "Great bathing suit.", "completion": "I think I screwed that one once."}
{"prompt": "A real turd.", "completion": "Well... hope she'll be very happy."}
{"prompt": "My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.", "completion": "Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?"}
{"prompt": "That's more like it.", "completion": "Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant."}
{"prompt": "Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.", "completion": "Give him the works."}
{"prompt": "Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.", "completion": "This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere."}
{"prompt": "I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "That's it, prick lips.", "completion": "What are you..."}
{"prompt": "They left an hour ago, pink nuts.", "completion": "Screw you!"}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about, asshole?", "completion": "Your whores never showed up."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Nice to meet you both.", "completion": "Jumbo, where the hell are the women?"}
{"prompt": "Park View Hotel, Room 1002.", "completion": "They'll be up there in a half hour."}
{"prompt": "So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.", "completion": "Let's see your bread."}
{"prompt": "Rick, I really think I'm in love.", "completion": "This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know you were into that.", "completion": "Gary, how we doing, big stallion?"}
{"prompt": "Hookers beat you up?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.", "completion": "Screw that."}
{"prompt": "Guy paints a beautiful picture.", "completion": "I'm going to see what the hell happened."}
{"prompt": "It's true.", "completion": "This place should have been wall to wall tits by now."}
{"prompt": "Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.", "completion": "What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.", "completion": "Let's have a toast."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?", "completion": "Because I love her. What can I tell you?"}
{"prompt": "Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?", "completion": "All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.", "completion": "Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody."}
{"prompt": "Gary, you're quite an animal.", "completion": "Screw you..."}
{"prompt": "Milt?", "completion": "Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys."}
{"prompt": "Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.", "completion": "Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you."}
{"prompt": "I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.", "completion": "You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes."}
{"prompt": "I'll take some.", "completion": "Big problem now. Soon they go to customers."}
{"prompt": "I want women.", "completion": "That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want."}
{"prompt": "You're a pimp?", "completion": "I'm telling you I am, Joe."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "What can I be doing for you?"}
{"prompt": "Is that all the coke in the place?", "completion": "That's it."}
{"prompt": "Larry, you and your wife got problems?", "completion": "I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends."}
{"prompt": "Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.", "completion": "I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch."}
{"prompt": "It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...", "completion": "So, Larry, how have you been?"}
{"prompt": "It's Bullwinkle.", "completion": "It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs..."}
{"prompt": "No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.", "completion": "Hi, guys. We brought back a friend."}
{"prompt": "Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.", "completion": "Ha, ha, ha."}
{"prompt": "You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?", "completion": "I couldn't find any razor blades."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you doing?", "completion": "I'm trying to slash my wrists."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party."}
{"prompt": "You okay?", "completion": "Yeah, I guess so."}
{"prompt": "Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.", "completion": "No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now."}
{"prompt": "I just want to be alone.", "completion": "All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after \"Falcon Crest.\""}
{"prompt": "Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.", "completion": "C'mon, Larry. Be good for you."}
{"prompt": "She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?", "completion": "What do you mean, it changes?"}
{"prompt": "My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.", "completion": "Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while."}
{"prompt": "Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!", "completion": "You want to share it?"}
{"prompt": "I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.", "completion": "You're all under arrest. Open up!"}
{"prompt": "What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.", "completion": "Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys."}
{"prompt": "Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.", "completion": "It's on the tenth floor."}
{"prompt": "Are any of those right?", "completion": "This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?"}
{"prompt": "Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...", "completion": "Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E."}
{"prompt": "The end.", "completion": "No sob story is going to change my mind."}
{"prompt": "Rick!", "completion": "Oh, no!"}
{"prompt": "First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...", "completion": "Welcome, welcome, one and all."}
{"prompt": "Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...", "completion": "Feel free."}
{"prompt": "Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.", "completion": "Mr. Thomerson, I..."}
{"prompt": "Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.", "completion": "I'd love that."}
{"prompt": "Can't I just maim it a little?", "completion": "Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience."}
{"prompt": "All right, who serves?", "completion": "Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it."}
{"prompt": "It's all right...  So have I.", "completion": "Oops!"}
{"prompt": "You've been having strange sex...!", "completion": "No, Brett, I..."}
{"prompt": "Ed... you're kinky!", "completion": "The phone made me do it!"}
{"prompt": "The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.", "completion": "You can tell a man by his friends."}
{"prompt": "Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?", "completion": "In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words."}
{"prompt": "Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.", "completion": "No. Let's at least finish the set."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "I'm separated.", "completion": "Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture."}
{"prompt": "Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.", "completion": "Mrs.?"}
{"prompt": "You got it.", "completion": "How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?"}
{"prompt": "What's with her costume?", "completion": "I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom."}
{"prompt": "Debbie.", "completion": "My Debbie?"}
{"prompt": "Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Reach out and snort someone.", "completion": "I'm saved. Let's party!"}
{"prompt": "What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.", "completion": "I'll stop him... You stall him."}
{"prompt": "And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...", "completion": "What are you going to do about it?"}
{"prompt": "Who's your friend?", "completion": "How about this, a Trojan donkey."}
{"prompt": "Take care.", "completion": "Hey, you guys..."}
{"prompt": "C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.", "completion": "Now, don't get into any trouble."}
{"prompt": "He look familiar?", "completion": "Very."}
{"prompt": "How 'bout this?", "completion": "Still drawing a blank."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "Got me."}
{"prompt": "Who was that?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.", "completion": "I'm proud of you, lad."}
{"prompt": "That's the old Rick!", "completion": "How'd it go?"}
{"prompt": "Right in there, pal.", "completion": "If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics."}
{"prompt": "I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.", "completion": "Oooooo."}
{"prompt": "This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.", "completion": "Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens."}
{"prompt": "Rick, I'm concerned.", "completion": "About what?"}
{"prompt": "I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?", "completion": "I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure."}
{"prompt": "I think you'll enjoy this table.", "completion": "So long, Father."}
{"prompt": "Under the table!", "completion": "The best table in the house."}
{"prompt": "What the hell is that?", "completion": "My gift to you."}
{"prompt": "I'm not really hungry.", "completion": "C'mon. I insist."}
{"prompt": "Don't you love it when old friends stop by?", "completion": "Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.", "completion": "This isn't right."}
{"prompt": "Olivier's in that, right?", "completion": "Then it's on to the real thing."}
{"prompt": "Nothing... Let's get crazy!", "completion": "We'll spend an hour with \"Nymphos Without Pants\"..."}
{"prompt": "Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.", "completion": "What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.", "completion": "Where the hell is he?"}
{"prompt": "Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?", "completion": "Where'd she go?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.", "completion": "Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party."}
{"prompt": "Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?", "completion": "Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts."}
{"prompt": "Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.", "completion": "Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next."}
{"prompt": "Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.", "completion": "Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break."}
{"prompt": "Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?", "completion": "That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood."}
{"prompt": "True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?", "completion": "You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that."}
{"prompt": "You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.", "completion": "Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me."}
{"prompt": "Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.", "completion": "Right... Think it over."}
{"prompt": "You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.", "completion": "Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book."}
{"prompt": "I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.", "completion": "There can be no excuse for tardiness."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.", "completion": "You're late again, Rick."}
{"prompt": "I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.", "completion": "Can you believe how perfect it fits?"}
{"prompt": "What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.", "completion": "Maybe I did... I don't remember."}
{"prompt": "How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!", "completion": "Stevie... I..."}
{"prompt": "...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?", "completion": "There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it."}
{"prompt": "-- Knock it off!", "completion": "-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --"}
{"prompt": "-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.", "completion": "They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department."}
{"prompt": "Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!", "completion": "Aw man, Stephen, listen to me..."}
{"prompt": "-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.", "completion": "Let me take the lead, Stephen..."}
{"prompt": "Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.", "completion": "It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one."}
{"prompt": "Biggest in two battalions.", "completion": "We're gonna be okay, man..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah...", "completion": "Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?"}
{"prompt": "No.  I need a drink.", "completion": "You know Knowlton pretty well?"}
{"prompt": "Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.", "completion": "Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?"}
{"prompt": "Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.", "completion": "That's Franny. She likes firemen."}
{"prompt": "No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.", "completion": "It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it."}
{"prompt": "Be gentle.", "completion": "Wash it to the windows?"}
{"prompt": "-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --", "completion": "Oh these moments do try me..."}
{"prompt": "-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --", "completion": "-- Stephen, this is bullshit --"}
{"prompt": "-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!", "completion": "-- He killed people --"}
{"prompt": "You gotta let me finish --", "completion": "Just come down, John. Just --"}
{"prompt": "Did you do it for Tim?", "completion": "That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!"}
{"prompt": "Is he...", "completion": "He's alive."}
{"prompt": "Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.", "completion": "John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.", "completion": "My Lt. might have something to say about that."}
{"prompt": "Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...", "completion": "I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't."}
{"prompt": "\"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --\"", "completion": "Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm..."}
{"prompt": "Shut up!", "completion": "You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?"}
{"prompt": "I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.", "completion": "You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?"}
{"prompt": "I'll handle it.", "completion": "We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen."}
{"prompt": "Anything else?", "completion": "What are we going to do about this?"}
{"prompt": "-- What were they doing there?", "completion": "They were for the fucking boat, Brian."}
{"prompt": "How do you know?", "completion": "I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me."}
{"prompt": "I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --", "completion": "-- What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?", "completion": "I don't know, Brian... I don't know..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.", "completion": "Sometimes right when you're looking at them."}
{"prompt": "...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?", "completion": "I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on..."}
{"prompt": "Everybody did.", "completion": "I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die."}
{"prompt": "Saw what?", "completion": "When dad died, I saw another fire..."}
{"prompt": "-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...", "completion": "I saw it."}
{"prompt": "-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!", "completion": "It's okay, Stephen, I --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.", "completion": "Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...", "completion": "I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do."}
{"prompt": "Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.", "completion": "You're selling dad's boat?"}
{"prompt": "Just... Just wanted to say hello...", "completion": "So hello."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you.", "completion": "Hey, what are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "I had that fire. He didn't listen!", "completion": "He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him."}
{"prompt": "...Not now, Brian.", "completion": "Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?"}
{"prompt": "Brian, look --", "completion": "Just leave me alone, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.", "completion": "Thanks for the insight."}
{"prompt": "Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?", "completion": "You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?"}
{"prompt": "I waited... I would have fucking waited...", "completion": "That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way."}
{"prompt": "Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Ready?", "completion": "Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team..."}
{"prompt": "No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.", "completion": "Roll the hose."}
{"prompt": "What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.", "completion": "You got a problem with drilling, probie?"}
{"prompt": "Roll the hose.", "completion": "What, are you kidding? By myself?"}
{"prompt": "This?", "completion": "Yeah... too bright..."}
{"prompt": "C'mon, let's crawl home.", "completion": "Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind..."}
{"prompt": "Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?", "completion": "Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too."}
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?"}
{"prompt": "Brian --  -- See ya tonight.", "completion": "Hey."}
{"prompt": "-- Never mind.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.", "completion": "C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose..."}
{"prompt": "-- I told you to stay next to me!", "completion": "-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!"}
{"prompt": "-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.", "completion": "Goddamn it Stephen!"}
{"prompt": "Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.", "completion": "-- C'mon, Stephen."}
{"prompt": "I'm in heaven, Lt.", "completion": "Hook us up to a stand-pipe."}
{"prompt": "I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.", "completion": "Ya love it, probie?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.", "completion": "I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the speakers.", "completion": "Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt..."}
{"prompt": "Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.", "completion": "There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer."}
{"prompt": "I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?", "completion": "So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?"}
{"prompt": "What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.", "completion": "Hey! You don't know me --"}
{"prompt": "Why'd you come here, Brian?", "completion": "I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother \"you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed\" games?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? What about Laura --", "completion": "That was never proved."}
{"prompt": "Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.", "completion": "Sheep don't count."}
{"prompt": "It worked when you were in sixth grade.", "completion": "People actually used to pay you for this?"}
{"prompt": "In the Field Museum once.", "completion": "It works."}
{"prompt": "My God, an actual operating 8-track.", "completion": "What, you've never seen one before?"}
{"prompt": "Been ripping off fire stations?", "completion": "It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub."}
{"prompt": "I like what you've done with the place.", "completion": "It's comin' along... want a beer?"}
{"prompt": "Not likely.", "completion": "Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian..."}
{"prompt": "So you're going to fight fires now, huh?", "completion": "Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother."}
{"prompt": "Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?", "completion": "I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me."}
{"prompt": "Who asked you?", "completion": "If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE."}
{"prompt": "It's a small town.", "completion": "It doesn't go like that."}
{"prompt": "I don't have the slightest idea...", "completion": "I'll see ya around, huh?"}
{"prompt": "I quit two days ago, Brian.", "completion": "What'll you do?"}
{"prompt": "You're right.", "completion": "I think your boss is going to need some spin control."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "That's a dumb thing to say."}
{"prompt": "What is --", "completion": "Just take it."}
{"prompt": "Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?", "completion": "Your boss is lying, Jennifer."}
{"prompt": "Do you know what you're asking me to do?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I don't know anything about it.", "completion": "You could check. It'd be in his files."}
{"prompt": "We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --", "completion": "Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "-- I work for the city.", "completion": "You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right."}
{"prompt": "Leave Stephen out of this --", "completion": "Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? And just how much of all this has been \"doing your job\"?", "completion": "Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --"}
{"prompt": "-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.", "completion": "I was doing my job."}
{"prompt": "-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --", "completion": "Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --"}
{"prompt": "You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.", "completion": "I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --"}
{"prompt": "Uh huh.", "completion": "Brian. What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "I wanted to be a good one.", "completion": "Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose."}
{"prompt": "When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.", "completion": "Then why did you quit?"}
{"prompt": "See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?", "completion": "Do you miss it?  You seem like you do."}
{"prompt": "This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?", "completion": "Homey."}
{"prompt": "Got anything to drink in there?", "completion": "Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies."}
{"prompt": "In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.", "completion": "Thanks for the invite."}
{"prompt": "Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.", "completion": "But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson."}
{"prompt": "No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.", "completion": "Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you did invite me here.", "completion": "Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to."}
{"prompt": "Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?", "completion": "You think that's really any of your business?"}
{"prompt": "Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?", "completion": "If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.", "completion": "I could use a date."}
{"prompt": "Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.", "completion": "Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come."}
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "Arson.", "completion": "Straightest answer your department's given me all week."}
{"prompt": "...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.", "completion": "Yeah..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.", "completion": "I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it."}
{"prompt": "So now you suddenly care about my future?", "completion": "Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us."}
{"prompt": "C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.", "completion": "Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once."}
{"prompt": "I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.", "completion": "Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that."}
{"prompt": "What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.", "completion": "Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters."}
{"prompt": "-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.", "completion": "Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?", "completion": "Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --"}
{"prompt": "Carrying Swayzak's notebook?", "completion": "Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor."}
{"prompt": "Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?", "completion": "Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here."}
{"prompt": "With grenadine, right?", "completion": "When I was twenty."}
{"prompt": "Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.", "completion": "I don't want to be your friend, Brian."}
{"prompt": "Really? No kidding.", "completion": "What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? What have you been up to?", "completion": "I work for city hall."}
{"prompt": "So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.", "completion": "Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now."}
{"prompt": "Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.", "completion": "Huh."}
{"prompt": "You look great.", "completion": "Thanks for calling."}
{"prompt": "Jennifer.", "completion": "You're back."}
{"prompt": "Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?", "completion": "Brian."}
{"prompt": "After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...", "completion": "Oh Jesus Christ..."}
{"prompt": "Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?", "completion": "Who the fuck is doing this?"}
{"prompt": "That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.", "completion": "Trychticholorate."}
{"prompt": "Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.", "completion": "The outlets."}
{"prompt": "Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!", "completion": "-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything..."}
{"prompt": "You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --", "completion": "I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal."}
{"prompt": "Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I don't have a story.", "completion": "Sure you do."}
{"prompt": "Then who --", "completion": "-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story."}
{"prompt": "Who's doing this?", "completion": "Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?"}
{"prompt": "So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...", "completion": "Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, do I know you?", "completion": "I'm close... but I can't get who it is..."}
{"prompt": "See you Monday. Sir.", "completion": "Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?"}
{"prompt": "No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.", "completion": "Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you."}
{"prompt": "I need another one, sir.", "completion": "Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year."}
{"prompt": "If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --", "completion": "-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot."}
{"prompt": "I want another shot, Sir.", "completion": "Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?"}
{"prompt": "If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.", "completion": "You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?"}
{"prompt": "Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.", "completion": "Like it never happened..."}
{"prompt": "Your brother was a good man.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "So what do you want me to do?", "completion": "I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place..."}
{"prompt": "Just wondering.", "completion": "I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless..."}
{"prompt": "Did I say thanks?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Did you pull me out?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...", "completion": "How ya feeling?"}
{"prompt": "Then who wrote the report?", "completion": "It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?"}
{"prompt": "I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.", "completion": "Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box."}
{"prompt": "This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.", "completion": "Yeah? Airtight?"}
{"prompt": "Nice bunch of guys.", "completion": "Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared."}
{"prompt": "So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...", "completion": "And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either."}
{"prompt": "Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.", "completion": "Son of a bitch. They knew each other."}
{"prompt": "In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?", "completion": "Fire."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you doing here?", "completion": "I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot."}
{"prompt": "Are you going public with this?", "completion": "No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away."}
{"prompt": "That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?", "completion": "No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point."}
{"prompt": "What reason?", "completion": "Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out."}
{"prompt": "But he killed these guys.", "completion": "But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts."}
{"prompt": "I don't work for them, either.", "completion": "That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!"}
{"prompt": "I don't guess.", "completion": "Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case."}
{"prompt": "Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier", "completion": "But the right guess on this is arson."}
{"prompt": "Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.", "completion": "And the putty around the door?"}
{"prompt": "Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.", "completion": "Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder."}
{"prompt": "\"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium\".", "completion": "Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!"}
{"prompt": "\"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --\"", "completion": "-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties."}
{"prompt": "I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...", "completion": "Read."}
{"prompt": "No it couldn't.", "completion": "Uh, I don't think that's in my contract..."}
{"prompt": "-- Another backdraft.", "completion": "Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire."}
{"prompt": "Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.", "completion": "Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air..."}
{"prompt": "So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.", "completion": "Glass?"}
{"prompt": "-- Shhh.", "completion": "What are you listening to?"}
{"prompt": "Where are you going?", "completion": "Pest control."}
{"prompt": "I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.", "completion": "Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me.

{"prompt": "Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.", "completion": "How 'bout..."}
{"prompt": "Let's go niggers!", "completion": "Louder.  They can't hear you."}
{"prompt": "Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!", "completion": "Let's go NIGGERS."}
{"prompt": "C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?", "completion": "YEAH!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah!", "completion": "I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show."}
{"prompt": "That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.", "completion": "My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?"}
{"prompt": "Everybody say Ho!", "completion": "Ho!"}
{"prompt": "My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.", "completion": "That's mighty black of you."}
{"prompt": "There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.", "completion": "If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house."}
{"prompt": "So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.", "completion": "That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else."}
{"prompt": "C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.", "completion": "You don't have the demographics."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, him.", "completion": "What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's."}
{"prompt": "If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?", "completion": "Delacroix."}
{"prompt": "We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.", "completion": "Please."}
{"prompt": "So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.", "completion": "Who are you revolting against?"}
{"prompt": "My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?", "completion": "Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?"}
{"prompt": "Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.", "completion": "I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.", "completion": "BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last."}
{"prompt": "I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.", "completion": "Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is..."}
{"prompt": "Well you did.", "completion": "Give me some?"}
{"prompt": "You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.", "completion": "I didn't mean to scare you like that."}
{"prompt": "We're ready when you are.", "completion": "Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself."}
{"prompt": "And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?", "completion": "We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science."}
{"prompt": "What's your name?", "completion": "My righteous name is BIG BLACK."}
{"prompt": "Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.", "completion": "The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's."}
{"prompt": "I'm a revolutionary.", "completion": "And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better..."}
{"prompt": "What do I do?", "completion": "What do you do?"}
{"prompt": "Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.", "completion": "And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?"}
{"prompt": "I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.", "completion": "Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head."}
{"prompt": "You can walk away.  We both can.", "completion": "Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent."}
{"prompt": "You're in this up till ya neck.", "completion": "Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players."}
{"prompt": "So that's what you been doing?", "completion": "Damn skippy."}
{"prompt": "I'm out.", "completion": "Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway."}
{"prompt": "Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.", "completion": "Meaning?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.", "completion": "What are you talkin' about?"}
{"prompt": "Why they gotta make my nose so big?", "completion": "Look at my lips."}
{"prompt": "Sloan never told us she had friends like you.", "completion": "In fact, we never knew she had any friends period."}
{"prompt": "Must be the pressure.", "completion": "Please, have a seat."}
{"prompt": "You ain't happy about the green light?", "completion": "What's wrong with him?"}
{"prompt": "Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.", "completion": "DeLa - what's the matter with you."}
{"prompt": "Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.", "completion": "You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff."}
{"prompt": "Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.", "completion": "Seconds and thirds, too."}
{"prompt": "She's also moorish.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.", "completion": "Certified ladies' man, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.", "completion": "It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face."}
{"prompt": "Why are you smiling so?", "completion": "I'm not smiling."}
{"prompt": "Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.", "completion": "You might be right."}
{"prompt": "We might need some mo' money behind this.", "completion": "That can be done."}
{"prompt": "And this is Manray.", "completion": "Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one."}
{"prompt": "You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.", "completion": "Nice to meet you."}
{"prompt": "Different.", "completion": "What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?"}
{"prompt": "First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.", "completion": "What kind of show is this gonna be?"}
{"prompt": "I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.", "completion": "How much?"}
{"prompt": "No offense.", "completion": "Manray needs a job."}
{"prompt": "Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.", "completion": "You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?"}
{"prompt": "De-la-croix.", "completion": "Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?"}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Cheeba.", "completion": "Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot."}
{"prompt": "That ain't funny.", "completion": "DeLa, I don't know 'bout this."}
{"prompt": "If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?", "completion": "We're starving."}
{"prompt": "We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.", "completion": "We was coming to see you."}
{"prompt": "We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?", "completion": "Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?"}
{"prompt": "Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.", "completion": "I'm tired of waiting."}
{"prompt": "Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.", "completion": "And I'm the feet."}
{"prompt": "Ahh, the luxuries of life.", "completion": "Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me."}
{"prompt": "Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.", "completion": "Did we get our bill yet?"}
{"prompt": "I'm starvin' like Marvin.", "completion": "My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon."}
{"prompt": "I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.", "completion": "No costume.  No blackface."}
{"prompt": "I won't do it anymore.", "completion": "Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional."}
{"prompt": "I'm not playin' myself no mo'.", "completion": "How you sound?"}
{"prompt": "Mantan?", "completion": "Mantan!!"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "You have to start getting into your character."}
{"prompt": "Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.", "completion": "I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind."}
{"prompt": "To what?", "completion": "You're now Mantan."}
{"prompt": "That's right.  Money turns the wheel.", "completion": "I would like to change your name."}
{"prompt": "Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.", "completion": "DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!"}
{"prompt": "Where do I sign?", "completion": "How different?"}
{"prompt": "What do I have to do?", "completion": "Some tap dancing, some singing."}
{"prompt": "My tap shoes.", "completion": "EUREKA!!"}
{"prompt": "Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.", "completion": "Well do something about it."}
{"prompt": "Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?", "completion": "Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon."}
{"prompt": "But the line has to be drawn.", "completion": "Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up."}
{"prompt": "No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?", "completion": "Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?"}
{"prompt": "Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?", "completion": "Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored."}
{"prompt": "I gots to go, it's my Moms.", "completion": "I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice."}
{"prompt": "Hold on a sec, I got a call.", "completion": "Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call."}
{"prompt": "This has to be a big mistake.", "completion": "The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street."}
{"prompt": "Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?", "completion": "They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together."}
{"prompt": "Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.", "completion": "I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings."}
{"prompt": "I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.", "completion": "We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier."}
{"prompt": "I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!", "completion": "Calm down, please."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.", "completion": "Dunwitty, don't leave."}
{"prompt": "In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!", "completion": "Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much."}
{"prompt": "That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?", "completion": "No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that."}
{"prompt": "What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?", "completion": "If Spielburg can direct \"The Color Purple\" and \"Amistad\", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."}
{"prompt": "Besides, what does he know about Negroes?", "completion": "Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless."}
{"prompt": "You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?", "completion": "I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind."}
{"prompt": "I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.", "completion": "I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video."}
{"prompt": "I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing \"Amos and Andy.\"  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.", "completion": "To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job."}
{"prompt": "We think so.", "completion": "Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?"}
{"prompt": "What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?", "completion": "That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!"}
{"prompt": "And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.", "completion": "I don't know about that plantation angle."}
{"prompt": "In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's \"The PJ's.\"", "completion": "Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama."}
{"prompt": "Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.", "completion": "We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?"}
{"prompt": "Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.", "completion": "Who are the other characters?"}
{"prompt": "Negroes would be in an uproar.", "completion": "So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing."}
{"prompt": "Protest finally forced \"Amos and Andy\" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.", "completion": "Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen."}
{"prompt": "Yep, you guessed it.", "completion": "This could be bigger than \"Amos and Andy.\""}
{"prompt": "Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.", "completion": "And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?"}
{"prompt": "Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.", "completion": "Exactly!"}
{"prompt": "Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.", "completion": "What are there character traits?"}
{"prompt": "Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.", "completion": "I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back."}
{"prompt": "Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?", "completion": "That's a great handle."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?", "completion": "I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go."}
{"prompt": "I'm feelin' dis'!", "completion": "It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial."}
{"prompt": "It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.", "completion": "I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister."}
{"prompt": "So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.", "completion": "The name of the show?"}
{"prompt": "I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?", "completion": "Word!!!"}
{"prompt": "I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.", "completion": "Go on.  Good so far."}
{"prompt": "We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.", "completion": "I'm wid it."}
{"prompt": "Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.", "completion": "It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan."}
{"prompt": "What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?", "completion": "Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you."}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.", "completion": "You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track."}
{"prompt": "I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some \"nigger\" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?", "completion": "That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know \"niggers\" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."}
{"prompt": "I've never been given a fair shot.", "completion": "You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white."}
{"prompt": "...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.", "completion": "Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk."}
{"prompt": "I'm telling you it's not.", "completion": "The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic..."}
{"prompt": "The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.", "completion": "I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom."}
{"prompt": "I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.", "completion": "NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER."}
{"prompt": "Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.", "completion": "I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know \"niggers\" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.", "completion": "I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed."}
{"prompt": "Do you know what C.P. Time is?", "completion": "C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance."}
{"prompt": "So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?", "completion": "I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator."}
{"prompt": "I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...", "completion": "Four minutes ago."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry I'm late.", "completion": "Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?"}
{"prompt": "Always keep 'em laughing.", "completion": "...exactly thirty-two minutes ago."}
{"prompt": "Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.", "completion": "I love you too, Daddy."}
{"prompt": "In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?", "completion": "Let's get him over to the bed."}
{"prompt": "Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.", "completion": "I didn't mean that, in life."}
{"prompt": "The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.", "completion": "Where do you go from here?"}
{"prompt": "Dem white boys giving you a hard time?", "completion": "Nuthin' I can't handle."}
{"prompt": "Enough about me, what's happening with you?", "completion": "The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through."}
{"prompt": "Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?", "completion": "All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the \"life's too short\" category."}
{"prompt": "Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.", "completion": "That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic."}
{"prompt": "That's what I'm askin'.", "completion": "Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do."}
{"prompt": "How did you end up here?", "completion": "How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?"}
{"prompt": "I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.", "completion": "I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink."}
{"prompt": "My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.", "completion": "Purely for medicinal purposes."}
{"prompt": "Good woman.  I trained her right.", "completion": "Daddy, she's younger than me."}
{"prompt": "Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.", "completion": "Pleased to meet you."}
{"prompt": "Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.", "completion": "It's been a long time."}
{"prompt": "Go away, unless you got my money.", "completion": "It's me, Peerless."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "I want to speak with you."}
{"prompt": "He never showed it.", "completion": "He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you."}
{"prompt": "Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.", "completion": "Your father is proud of you."}
{"prompt": "So what's up with you?", "completion": "I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since."}
{"prompt": "So he drank himself into a stuper?", "completion": "The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it."}
{"prompt": "How long has my father been like this?", "completion": "Not that often.  He was excited to see you."}
{"prompt": "Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.", "completion": "Is that so?"}
{"prompt": "I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.", "completion": "Give me the gun."}
{"prompt": "Don't make me have to use this.", "completion": "I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU."}
{"prompt": "DeLa, kiss my big black ass.", "completion": "And that's how you got me in the first place."}
{"prompt": "Work related or otherwise?", "completion": "Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU."}
{"prompt": "That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.", "completion": "The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore."}
{"prompt": "This is crazy.", "completion": "That's why it will be so much fun."}
{"prompt": "That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.", "completion": "You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you."}
{"prompt": "DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.", "completion": "Light?"}
{"prompt": "I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.", "completion": "Do you have to be so damn forthright?"}
{"prompt": "Please don't go there.", "completion": "Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up."}
{"prompt": "He's just playing big brother.", "completion": "Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?"}
{"prompt": "You're the one that put us together. We're friends.", "completion": "That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to hear it.", "completion": "How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?"}
{"prompt": "To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.", "completion": "Why'd you do that?"}
{"prompt": "It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.", "completion": "How so?"}
{"prompt": "I thought it was appropiate.", "completion": "Is that good or bad?"}
{"prompt": "This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.", "completion": "The Jolly Nigger Bank."}
{"prompt": "A gift.", "completion": "For what?"}
{"prompt": "A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "Everybody shut up.", "completion": "So you have your small victory, now what?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.", "completion": "What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest."}
{"prompt": "C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.", "completion": "Who's side are you on?"}
{"prompt": "The pleasure is mine.", "completion": "I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you."}
{"prompt": "Just don't lie to me.", "completion": "Same here."}
{"prompt": "We both lied to him.", "completion": "What do you want me to say?"}
{"prompt": "Your life will never be the same.", "completion": "Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready."}
{"prompt": "Just want to say good luck.", "completion": "Break a leg."}
{"prompt": "You've said that already.", "completion": "I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph."}
{"prompt": "Which one is your brother?", "completion": "The big one."}
{"prompt": "I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.", "completion": "This is the group I was telling you about."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.", "completion": "Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it."}
{"prompt": "Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.", "completion": "What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?"}
{"prompt": "It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.", "completion": "Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.", "completion": "Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?"}
{"prompt": "I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.", "completion": "What is your problem?"}
{"prompt": "This is Cheeba.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.", "completion": "Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death."}
{"prompt": "Good.  I'm going to need your support.", "completion": "Can't you just quit?  Walk away?"}
{"prompt": "You getting cold feet?", "completion": "I'm in till the end."}
{"prompt": "The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.", "completion": "Sounds risky to me."}
{"prompt": "Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.", "completion": "What point is that?"}
{"prompt": "Not yet, but this thing will never get made.", "completion": "You lost me."}
{"prompt": "Manray was under our nose the whole time.", "completion": "Do you know how you will use him?"}
{"prompt": "How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.", "completion": "The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?"}
{"prompt": "How did you know?", "completion": "It hit me like a ton of bricks."}
{"prompt": "Manray!", "completion": "Manray!"}
{"prompt": "What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?", "completion": "It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known."}
{"prompt": "Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?", "completion": "Nobody told me anything."}
{"prompt": "I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's \"LAUGH-IN.\"", "completion": "How was it?"}
{"prompt": "This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.", "completion": "David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud."}
{"prompt": "I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.", "completion": "Oh, is that what I'm doing?"}
{"prompt": "He, I'm Mona.", "completion": "Hi, Mona."}
{"prompt": "Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.", "completion": "Yes, your name?"}
{"prompt": "Mantan, we got a show to tape.", "completion": "My name is Manray, goddamnit."}
{"prompt": "I don't believe it.", "completion": "Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself."}
{"prompt": "Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.", "completion": "Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity."}
{"prompt": "What you did is dead wrong.", "completion": "Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired."}
{"prompt": "And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.", "completion": "You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan."}
{"prompt": "You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?", "completion": "Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece."}
{"prompt": "What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.", "completion": "In time."}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.", "completion": "No joke.  Serious."}
{"prompt": "This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.", "completion": "Same thing Giuliani said."}
{"prompt": "So they can be on TV.", "completion": "You sound like the media."}
{"prompt": "Not nervous?  Relaxed?", "completion": "Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready."}
{"prompt": "You feel good, not nervous?", "completion": "I feel fine."}
{"prompt": "Can I kiss you too?", "completion": "Naw.  I'll take the zero."}
{"prompt": "Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.", "completion": "The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way."}
{"prompt": "I didn't mean it to sound like that.", "completion": "That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?"}
{"prompt": "I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.", "completion": "Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure."}
{"prompt": "I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?", "completion": "Soon."}
{"prompt": "You know how your Daddy is.", "completion": "If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Not at all?"}
{"prompt": "Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.", "completion": "Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?"}
{"prompt": "I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.", "completion": "You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?"}
{"prompt": "C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.", "completion": "Peerless, last time, go see your father."}
{"prompt": "It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.", "completion": "Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success."}
{"prompt": "I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.", "completion": "Regardless, he still is your father."}
{"prompt": "I can't go all the way down south.", "completion": "Richmond is not all the way down south."}
{"prompt": "Where is he?", "completion": "He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia."}
{"prompt": "He said that?", "completion": "Yes he did."}
{"prompt": "I'll be right over.", "completion": "He wants you to come and see him."}
{"prompt": "I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.", "completion": "Peerless, your father called."}
{"prompt": "Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.", "completion": "Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something."}
{"prompt": "I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?", "completion": "To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?"}
{"prompt": "Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.", "completion": "I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?"}
{"prompt": "If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.", "completion": "Mommy, please don't call me that."}
{"prompt": "That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?", "completion": "It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show."}
{"prompt": "How's the food?", "completion": "Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot."}
{"prompt": "C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.", "completion": "I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong."}
{"prompt": "It looks delicious.", "completion": "You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much.  I always try my best.", "completion": "You must think I'm some kind of fool."}
{"prompt": "This is a travesty.  A debacle.", "completion": "Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show."}
{"prompt": "This is a TV show, not a music video.", "completion": "Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?"}
{"prompt": "How did you get this gig?", "completion": "My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?"}
{"prompt": "Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.", "completion": "Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team."}
{"prompt": "Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!", "completion": "Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?"}
{"prompt": "What's a Negro.", "completion": "A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination."}
{"prompt": "You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?", "completion": "Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?"}
{"prompt": "Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.", "completion": "Finland."}
{"prompt": "I just turned twenty.", "completion": "Where are you from?"}
{"prompt": "This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.", "completion": "Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  And always smile.", "completion": "Yes you!"}
{"prompt": "We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.", "completion": "Let Myrna finish."}
{"prompt": "The best defense is offense.", "completion": "The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, \"F\" 'em."}
{"prompt": "First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.", "completion": "Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy."}
{"prompt": "I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.", "completion": "I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz."}
{"prompt": "Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.", "completion": "I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world."}
{"prompt": "If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.", "completion": "You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing."}
{"prompt": "No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.", "completion": "I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout."}
{"prompt": "A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.", "completion": "So what's up with you and DeLa?"}
{"prompt": "I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.", "completion": "You sing and dance?"}
{"prompt": "You've never had any formal training, either?", "completion": "Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself."}
{"prompt": "I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.", "completion": "I never had a really real pair before."}
{"prompt": "Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?", "completion": "I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time."}
{"prompt": "Is it inevitable that the game plays you?", "completion": "No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better."}
{"prompt": "Money and nothing else?", "completion": "Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game."}
{"prompt": "Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?", "completion": "Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, \"it's all about the Benjamins.\""}
{"prompt": "Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.", "completion": "I'm more comfortable around my people."}
{"prompt": "Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.", "completion": "Tavis, thank you for having me."}
{"prompt": "I feel a song a comin' on.", "completion": "A song a comin' I feel."}
{"prompt": "Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.", "completion": "Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.", "completion": "Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother."}
{"prompt": "How be dat?", "completion": "I don't know who I am."}
{"prompt": "Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?", "completion": "Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately."}
{"prompt": "Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?", "completion": "Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me."}
{"prompt": "You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.", "completion": "Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?"}
{"prompt": "You slept too near where you got in?", "completion": "I slept too near where I fell out."}
{"prompt": "...like fried and chicken...", "completion": "I fell out of my bed last night."}
{"prompt": "...like macaroni and cheese...", "completion": "...like grits and butter..."}
{"prompt": "...perfect...", "completion": "That's what I like about you and me. We git along..."}
{"prompt": "...then what about...", "completion": "...too late, maybe around..."}
{"prompt": "Around...", "completion": "...too early..."}
{"prompt": "...not that time...", "completion": "So when are you comin' to pick us up?"}
{"prompt": "...yes she did.", "completion": "...I heard different, thought that was..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, because on our first date, she let me...", "completion": "...no, she didn't..."}
{"prompt": "I heard ya lady is wild.", "completion": "No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit."}
{"prompt": "I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.", "completion": "We should go out on a double date."}
{"prompt": "...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...", "completion": "...aconite get it dat cheap."}
{"prompt": "I thought you got rid of...", "completion": "...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round..."}
{"prompt": "That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.", "completion": "Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for..."}
{"prompt": "Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...", "completion": "...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose."}
{"prompt": "Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?", "completion": "Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy..."}
{"prompt": "No, not that.  How 'bout...", "completion": "She hates dem."}
{"prompt": "Oh her.", "completion": "Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a..."}
{"prompt": "The one with da big...", "completion": "Not her, the one with the little..."}
{"prompt": "Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!", "completion": "Y'know my lady Lucindy?"}
{"prompt": "Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.", "completion": "You tellin' the truth."}
{"prompt": "Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.", "completion": "Give or cousins some of dem educated feets."}
{"prompt": "No mo' \"city slickers.\"  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?", "completion": "Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan."}
{"prompt": "To come back to our roots.", "completion": "Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's."}
{"prompt": "We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...", "completion": "...the big apple, New York, New York."}
{"prompt": "This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.", "completion": "And this is my very best friend Mantan."}
{"prompt": "You can go now.", "completion": "I wuz leaving anyway, for good."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you answer?", "completion": "I know I won't be your puppet."}
{"prompt": "Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?", "completion": "Don't try to change to the subject."}
{"prompt": "That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.", "completion": "So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like \"IHOP.\"  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."}
{"prompt": "We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.", "completion": "Aw, c'mon."}
{"prompt": "Say what, Manray?", "completion": "Did you ever sleep with DeLa?"}
{"prompt": "Just ask me what you want to know.", "completion": "Oh, you gonna make me say it."}
{"prompt": "And what?", "completion": "Stop playing me Sloan."}
{"prompt": "After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.", "completion": "And?"}
{"prompt": "Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.", "completion": "You leave something out?"}
{"prompt": "You look beautiful like that.", "completion": "How did you get this gig?"}
{"prompt": "Y'know what?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "My people love me.", "completion": "I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on."}
{"prompt": "For what?  He left.  Not me.", "completion": "You're sure this is a good idea."}
{"prompt": "We can look out for ourselves.", "completion": "Why don't you call him?"}
{"prompt": "Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.", "completion": "I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I need to do a lot of things.", "completion": "Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?"}
{"prompt": "Never read a book in my whole life.", "completion": "Maybe you need to start."}
{"prompt": "No, before my time.", "completion": "You don't read, do you?"}
{"prompt": "Gots no intention of ending up broke.", "completion": "Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist."}
{"prompt": "Just a little something' somethin'.", "completion": "I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'."}
{"prompt": "Sloan, I got it like 'dat.", "completion": "Oh you do, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Are you trying to rap to me?", "completion": "This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny."}
{"prompt": "I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.", "completion": "What else?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want to know?", "completion": "The good stuff."}
{"prompt": "Enough.", "completion": "So what's up with you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.", "completion": "A lot?"}
{"prompt": "Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.", "completion": "People show their happiness in a lot of different ways."}
{"prompt": "That is none of your business.", "completion": "Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?"}
{"prompt": "Good morning.", "completion": "Where are you bound for?"}
{"prompt": "Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.", "completion": "Good day to you, young sir."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?", "completion": "Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.", "completion": "You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that."}
{"prompt": "If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.", "completion": "Both of us ride home with Best here."}
{"prompt": "I never was more in earnest.", "completion": "And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --"}
{"prompt": "It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.", "completion": "Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking."}
{"prompt": "I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.", "completion": "Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones."}
{"prompt": "Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.", "completion": "Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?"}
{"prompt": "You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.", "completion": "And his baggage?"}
{"prompt": "Has he sent the challenge yet?", "completion": "Not yet, but I believe he intends to."}
{"prompt": "What are the Chevalier's intentions?", "completion": "I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it."}
{"prompt": "Only a very little, as soldiers do.", "completion": "I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys."}
{"prompt": "There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.", "completion": "You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?"}
{"prompt": "Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.", "completion": "What is the service, sir?"}
{"prompt": "How do you do, sir?", "completion": "The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion."}
{"prompt": "Neither!", "completion": "Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I'm a British officer.", "completion": "It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?"}
{"prompt": "Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.", "completion": "I have acted as I think fit."}
{"prompt": "Where's the beauty you promised me?", "completion": "It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile."}
{"prompt": "The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.", "completion": "The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?", "completion": "Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you."}
{"prompt": "This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?", "completion": "This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach."}
{"prompt": "O'Grady.", "completion": "Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady..."}
{"prompt": "My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.", "completion": "What is your uncle's name?"}
{"prompt": "The coward!", "completion": "He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!", "completion": "No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made."}
{"prompt": "Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?", "completion": "She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best."}
{"prompt": "Is Miss Dugan well?", "completion": "There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy."}
{"prompt": "We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to \"Brown Bess.\"", "completion": "I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown."}
{"prompt": "I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.", "completion": "I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office."}
{"prompt": "A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.", "completion": "Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family."}
{"prompt": "It must have been some other gate.", "completion": "Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off."}
{"prompt": "But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.", "completion": "Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years."}
{"prompt": "Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.", "completion": "I'll match any man with the sword."}
{"prompt": "I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.", "completion": "I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body."}
{"prompt": "It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.", "completion": "And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world."}
{"prompt": "Your cousins go out with him.", "completion": "That's a very handsome sword you have there."}
{"prompt": "The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.", "completion": "My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?"}
{"prompt": "In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.", "completion": "Have you taken my message to him?"}
{"prompt": "Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.", "completion": "He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him."}
{"prompt": "And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?", "completion": "Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?"}
{"prompt": "A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.", "completion": "And so I am."}
{"prompt": "Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!", "completion": "Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word."}
{"prompt": "This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.", "completion": "The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?"}
{"prompt": "Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.", "completion": "Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud."}
{"prompt": "Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!", "completion": "You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!"}
{"prompt": "I have heard of them.", "completion": "Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.", "completion": "Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown."}
{"prompt": "Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?", "completion": "Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family."}
{"prompt": "Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.", "completion": "I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls."}
{"prompt": "Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.", "completion": "I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night."}
{"prompt": "Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.", "completion": "Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time."}
{"prompt": "I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "The gentleman has nothing contraband.", "completion": "Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me."}
{"prompt": "As you please.", "completion": "I have no luggage."}
{"prompt": "Your honor must lower his voice.", "completion": "All Europe shall hear of this!"}
{"prompt": "I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.", "completion": "Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand."}
{"prompt": "You are going to drive to the frontier.", "completion": "It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house."}
{"prompt": "I will let down the steps for your honor.", "completion": "Good gracious!  What is this?"}
{"prompt": "Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.", "completion": "Where is my rascal, Lazlo?"}
{"prompt": "I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.", "completion": "Certain?"}
{"prompt": "It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.", "completion": "To risk one's life against such people is an imposition."}
{"prompt": "When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?", "completion": "Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you."}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?", "completion": "Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier."}
{"prompt": "Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.", "completion": "But how, sir?"}
{"prompt": "I have faced that problem before.", "completion": "But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?"}
{"prompt": "Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.", "completion": "I believe they will deport you."}
{"prompt": "We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.", "completion": "But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost."}
{"prompt": "The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?", "completion": "I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill."}
{"prompt": "And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.", "completion": "I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place."}
{"prompt": "Who else can give me information about you?", "completion": "Only the agency of servants."}
{"prompt": "For whom else have you worked?", "completion": "No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins."}
{"prompt": "You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.", "completion": "Herr Seebach was a very kind employer."}
{"prompt": "Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?", "completion": "Yes, sir.  Here is my letter."}
{"prompt": "That is a trifle strong.", "completion": "Take to your legs, low Irish dog."}
{"prompt": "On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.", "completion": "Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs."}
{"prompt": "Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.", "completion": "Then you yield to me."}
{"prompt": "Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?", "completion": "Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals."}
{"prompt": "Old fool!", "completion": "I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady."}
{"prompt": "Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.", "completion": "Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool."}
{"prompt": "We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  \"Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?\"", "completion": "My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:"}
{"prompt": "Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.", "completion": "As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much."}
{"prompt": "O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!", "completion": "Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes."}
{"prompt": "Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.", "completion": "Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it."}
{"prompt": "Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.", "completion": "My husband has convinced me of the contrary."}
{"prompt": "I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.", "completion": "Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires."}
{"prompt": "Will we always leave it at this?", "completion": "Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it."}
{"prompt": "Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?", "completion": "I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet."}
{"prompt": "You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?", "completion": "Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived."}
{"prompt": "And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?", "completion": "Then I will respectfully take leave of her."}
{"prompt": "Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?", "completion": "With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight."}
{"prompt": "Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.", "completion": "But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer."}
{"prompt": "To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.", "completion": "The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me."}
{"prompt": "It is my only object.", "completion": "To make me wretched in two weeks."}
{"prompt": "By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.", "completion": "You want my heart?"}
{"prompt": "I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.", "completion": "How so?"}
{"prompt": "I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.", "completion": "A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws."}
{"prompt": "That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.", "completion": "It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last."}
{"prompt": "It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.", "completion": "But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune."}
{"prompt": "Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.", "completion": "Your word \"empty\" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."}
{"prompt": "What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?", "completion": "Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved."}
{"prompt": "Have you not a man whom you value?", "completion": "That man has, perhaps, not yet been born."}
{"prompt": "How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?", "completion": "Not one."}
{"prompt": "But, for a time... a passing fancy?", "completion": "Not even that."}
{"prompt": "Have you had one?", "completion": "Never."}
{"prompt": "Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --", "completion": "Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?"}
{"prompt": "What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?", "completion": "Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us."}
{"prompt": "Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.", "completion": "I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them."}
{"prompt": "If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.", "completion": "But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter."}
{"prompt": "But you refused me, Dorothy.", "completion": "Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world."}
{"prompt": "Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?", "completion": "I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?"}
{"prompt": "I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.", "completion": "I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set."}
{"prompt": "Why are you shaking?", "completion": "With pleasure at finding the ribbon."}
{"prompt": "I feel the ribbon.", "completion": "Then you must get it."}
{"prompt": "Agreed.", "completion": "Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner."}
{"prompt": "All right, five hundred guineas.", "completion": "I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases."}
{"prompt": "It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.", "completion": "Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more."}
{"prompt": "Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.", "completion": "All the same, you must name an amount."}
{"prompt": "As much as possible.", "completion": "As much as possible?"}
{"prompt": "Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.", "completion": "I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?"}
{"prompt": "Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "By name only.", "completion": "Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get."}
{"prompt": "And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.", "completion": "Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?"}
{"prompt": "Then this must be done tomorrow.", "completion": "What is to be done?"}
{"prompt": "The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.", "completion": "When is he to go?"}
{"prompt": "A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.", "completion": "The Prince left him only that choice."}
{"prompt": "In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.", "completion": "Hmm-mmmm."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.", "completion": "Was he cheated?"}
{"prompt": "You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.", "completion": "Does this assignment interest you?"}
{"prompt": "That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.", "completion": "How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum."}
{"prompt": "O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.", "completion": "As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?"}
{"prompt": "I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.", "completion": "But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?"}
{"prompt": "Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...", "completion": "That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him \"good luck.\"", "completion": "Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?"}
{"prompt": "When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.", "completion": "What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?"}
{"prompt": "Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.", "completion": "I see."}
{"prompt": "May I be quite frank with you?", "completion": "Yes, of course."}
{"prompt": "There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.", "completion": "Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?"}
{"prompt": "Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.", "completion": "I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe."}
{"prompt": "I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.", "completion": "Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed."}
{"prompt": "Yes, he's fine.", "completion": "Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away."}
{"prompt": "Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.", "completion": "Is he all right, papa?"}
{"prompt": "I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.", "completion": "Yes, papa."}
{"prompt": "One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?", "completion": "What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?"}
{"prompt": "Papa?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Good night, papa.", "completion": "Good night, my little darling."}
{"prompt": "But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?", "completion": "Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?"}
{"prompt": "Did you buy the horse, papa?", "completion": "Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week."}
{"prompt": "Sir, let those laugh that win.", "completion": "I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?"}
{"prompt": "I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?", "completion": "Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting."}
{"prompt": "Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?", "completion": "Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?"}
{"prompt": "Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?", "completion": "He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!"}
{"prompt": "I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.", "completion": "Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?"}
{"prompt": "I beg your pardon?", "completion": "Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool."}
{"prompt": "Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.", "completion": "Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?"}
{"prompt": "The milkmaid's daughter?", "completion": "Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains."}
{"prompt": "Would you have me spend my life all alone?", "completion": "In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge."}
{"prompt": "Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.", "completion": "Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry."}
{"prompt": "Tender Hegenheim.", "completion": "I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth."}
{"prompt": "Will he wish to know the details of this night?", "completion": "He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him."}
{"prompt": "If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.", "completion": "He loves me, as I love you."}
{"prompt": "And he doesn't care about me?", "completion": "He is only curious to know who you are."}
{"prompt": "Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?", "completion": "Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight."}
{"prompt": "Black-eyed Sczortarska.", "completion": "Dark Valdez."}
{"prompt": "Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?", "completion": "Charming Schuvaloff."}
{"prompt": "Bill Styles...", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Hurricane kept you up, too?", "completion": "Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going."}
{"prompt": "You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.", "completion": "Don't you mean \"don't need no liquor license not taken away from me\"?"}
{"prompt": "It's ten thirty in the morning.", "completion": "Yeah, if you've slept."}
{"prompt": "You know that was like a quadruple negative?", "completion": "Can I at least have a drink?"}
{"prompt": "None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?", "completion": "Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me."}
{"prompt": "Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --", "completion": "You framed-him..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.", "completion": "He is the only one unaccounted for."}
{"prompt": "It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!", "completion": "What about Pike?"}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Did -- did you --"}
{"prompt": "Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...", "completion": "I don't want to go --"}
{"prompt": "Fuck, what the fuck is going on --", "completion": "What do we do?"}
{"prompt": "I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.", "completion": "Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this."}
{"prompt": "I'm -- I'm sorry...", "completion": "A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up, Mueller.", "completion": "Don't you ever point a gun at me!"}
{"prompt": "HEY!", "completion": "West was one thing, but this --"}
{"prompt": "I don't know!", "completion": "Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP."}
{"prompt": "We got -- I don't know, we got separated", "completion": "Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --"}
{"prompt": "You killed him you fucking faggot --", "completion": "We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?", "completion": "We found him like this --"}
{"prompt": "This isn't our area. Whose area is this --", "completion": "Can anybody hear me!"}
{"prompt": "You too?", "completion": "We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right...", "completion": "Shut up.  West's dead."}
{"prompt": "Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?", "completion": "We found him like this..."}
{"prompt": "What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --", "completion": "What do you mean, alone?"}
{"prompt": "We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?", "completion": "We don't know. West is dead."}
{"prompt": "Washout rejects, guys he said were \"dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead\"...", "completion": "He's telling the truth up to a point..."}
{"prompt": "You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.", "completion": "I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are..."}
{"prompt": "I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.", "completion": "And the bodies?"}
{"prompt": "Do what?", "completion": "Hunting -- we had to hunt him --"}
{"prompt": "Jesus!", "completion": "He -- He made me do it --"}
{"prompt": "We've found all of them.", "completion": "Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --"}
{"prompt": "We don't need the tapes --", "completion": "Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?"}
{"prompt": "We're not finished yet --", "completion": "You wanna bet?"}
{"prompt": "Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --", "completion": "Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die."}
{"prompt": "You saved Kendall's life --", "completion": "But not Pike's."}
{"prompt": "You shot Childs and Nunez.", "completion": "They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession."}
{"prompt": "And he'd been shot.", "completion": "Yeah --"}
{"prompt": "You saw West's body.", "completion": "Of course --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, we know, Pike did.", "completion": "I apologize --"}
{"prompt": "So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --", "completion": "I didn't shoot West --"}
{"prompt": "Fuck \"you're serious\", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.", "completion": "Did Kendall tell you about the PX?"}
{"prompt": "Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --", "completion": "I'm serious --"}
{"prompt": "That'd be my reaction too --", "completion": "He's lying."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!", "completion": "That son of a bitch."}
{"prompt": "This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.", "completion": "No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.", "completion": "You smoke, Ray?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me about them.", "completion": "And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?"}
{"prompt": "Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?", "completion": "Some."}
{"prompt": "Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?", "completion": "I'm not telling you what happened."}
{"prompt": "Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "There's no need...", "completion": "They're dead, aren't they?"}
{"prompt": "You did Basic here?", "completion": "Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I like the Army.", "completion": "C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here."}
{"prompt": "I just don't like it.", "completion": "What do you like then?"}
{"prompt": "It's... too slow.", "completion": "Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty."}
{"prompt": "I asked for a policeman.", "completion": "You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?"}
{"prompt": "Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Ohhhh, I don't think so...", "completion": "How do you know that?"}
{"prompt": "We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --", "completion": "Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?"}
{"prompt": "Can't do that now, though, can you?", "completion": "Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it."}
{"prompt": "Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.", "completion": "You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too."}
{"prompt": "Would you have believed me?", "completion": "Where's the cabin?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "Back up.", "completion": "Mueller was alone in the cabin?"}
{"prompt": "What about the phosphorous grenade?", "completion": "One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --"}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "The creek bed --"}
{"prompt": "What business?", "completion": "Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --"}
{"prompt": "He said he worked there --", "completion": "No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?"}
{"prompt": "Epilepsy.", "completion": "Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week."}
{"prompt": "There were six of us...", "completion": "He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?"}
{"prompt": "That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.", "completion": "Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out."}
{"prompt": "Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?", "completion": "No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck is going on?", "completion": "Your weapons, Sergeant."}
{"prompt": "Sir, yes, sir!", "completion": "The rest of you, fallout for physicals!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, yes, sir!", "completion": "Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?"}
{"prompt": "Sir, Dunbar, sir!", "completion": "You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?"}
{"prompt": "I...", "completion": "Cadet, what's your name!"}
{"prompt": "So did we. Why didn't you come?", "completion": "So you killed him?"}
{"prompt": "West... he's dead.", "completion": "Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close."}
{"prompt": "We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.", "completion": "Jesus, what happened?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --", "completion": "I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!"}
{"prompt": "Put it down!", "completion": "He wouldn't kill anybody..."}
{"prompt": "We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.", "completion": "A test will no doubt link you to the killing --"}
{"prompt": "There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --", "completion": "No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --"}
{"prompt": "What don't you know?", "completion": "This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --"}
{"prompt": "Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...", "completion": "I... I don't know..."}
{"prompt": "Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...", "completion": "They?"}
{"prompt": "His chest was hamburger --", "completion": "That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Full clip to the body --", "completion": "From up close or far away?"}
{"prompt": "That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.", "completion": "You saw West, right? How was he killed?"}
{"prompt": "Why... why didn't you tell me?", "completion": "Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know."}
{"prompt": "You're lying --", "completion": "Pull up my sleeve. Right arm."}
{"prompt": "Just look. Little pocket.", "completion": "Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me."}
{"prompt": "Look in my pack.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --", "completion": "Bullshit."}
{"prompt": "Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?", "completion": "You hated West, Mueller loved him --"}
{"prompt": "We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --", "completion": "That's exactly what he says about you."}
{"prompt": "Mueller.", "completion": "Oh, come on --"}
{"prompt": "Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.", "completion": "If not you, then who?"}
{"prompt": "You're the only one missing a grenade.", "completion": "Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?"}
{"prompt": "You hated West more than any of us.", "completion": "Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah...", "completion": "You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray."}
{"prompt": "Do I?", "completion": "Right?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "You know it's not like that --"}
{"prompt": "Roberto, what the fuck?", "completion": "We just want to check your pack --"}
{"prompt": "Where have you been, Jay?", "completion": "Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean, West's?", "completion": "I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?"}
{"prompt": "Whose blood is that, Jay?", "completion": "West's. Any kindling for afire?"}
{"prompt": "MAYBE WHAT --", "completion": "Maybe he..."}
{"prompt": "Where are they!", "completion": "Maybe --"}
{"prompt": "You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!", "completion": "I don't know --"}
{"prompt": "I didn't --", "completion": "But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!"}
{"prompt": "Because I was standing next to him.", "completion": "Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?"}
{"prompt": "Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.", "completion": "How do you know?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't do anything --", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.", "completion": "Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --"}
{"prompt": "Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.", "completion": "Something funny, Levi?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?", "completion": "Dunbar will testify that you were."}
{"prompt": "I believe your next line is \"What are you trying to hide?\"", "completion": "Well?"}
{"prompt": "No. I said Dunbar.", "completion": "Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said \"Dunbar was gone,\" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie."}
{"prompt": "So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --", "completion": "Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door."}
{"prompt": "There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.", "completion": "Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --"}
{"prompt": "My heart weeps.", "completion": "Is it the truth?"}
{"prompt": "Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?", "completion": "Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer."}
{"prompt": "You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --", "completion": "How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten."}
{"prompt": "Somebody emptied a full clip into him --", "completion": "Stop."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.", "completion": "Mr. Hardy?"}
{"prompt": "Why did he come back for you?", "completion": "I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men."}
{"prompt": "He admitted it.", "completion": "Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back."}
{"prompt": "But you didn't.", "completion": "No. Poetic justice, though."}
{"prompt": "Then who did?", "completion": "Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him."}
{"prompt": "What happened to \"degrees\"?", "completion": "I didn't kill him --"}
{"prompt": "Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called \"motive\" and you just gave yourself one.", "completion": "You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth."}
{"prompt": "I think you just blew \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" out of the fucking water.", "completion": "The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay."}
{"prompt": "Senator Daddy must be thrilled.", "completion": "He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?"}
{"prompt": "My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.", "completion": "My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual."}
{"prompt": "I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.", "completion": "But not the only victim, right?"}
{"prompt": "That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --", "completion": "Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us."}
{"prompt": "You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?", "completion": "Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk."}
{"prompt": "For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --", "completion": "Get your hands away from the desk!"}
{"prompt": "You're crazy --", "completion": "You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen."}
{"prompt": "Not for long.", "completion": "No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough."}
{"prompt": "No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --", "completion": "You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you."}
{"prompt": "You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.", "completion": "I'm not even going to dignify that --"}
{"prompt": "Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.", "completion": "I wanted to see if he was okay --"}
{"prompt": "What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.", "completion": "That's preposterous --"}
{"prompt": "Or what? You've gone round the bend --", "completion": "West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done."}
{"prompt": "I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.", "completion": "Stay where you are."}
{"prompt": "If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.", "completion": "You're drunk --"}
{"prompt": "It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "You're a good soldier, Bill.", "completion": "I thought you said that wasn't a compliment."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Bill.", "completion": "Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world."}
{"prompt": "They're taking your command, aren't they?", "completion": "The Senator..."}
{"prompt": "You think you could explain all this to me?", "completion": "I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings."}
{"prompt": "That's horseshit and you know it.", "completion": "Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it."}
{"prompt": "Does Osborne agree?", "completion": "It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter."}
{"prompt": "Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --", "completion": "What I said before --"}
{"prompt": "You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --", "completion": "What the hell are you talking about --"}
{"prompt": "Home, I'm done.", "completion": "What about the confession?"}
{"prompt": "JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.", "completion": "Tom, where are you going --"}
{"prompt": "Not for me.", "completion": "You mean not enough to save you."}
{"prompt": "Nevertheless --", "completion": "Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough."}
{"prompt": "Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.", "completion": "From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty."}
{"prompt": "Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.", "completion": "Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --"}
{"prompt": "We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.", "completion": "There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it."}
{"prompt": "Who killed Pike?", "completion": "Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target."}
{"prompt": "He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.", "completion": "Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez."}
{"prompt": "I'm not gonna let that happen.", "completion": "He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --"}
{"prompt": "And I'm the closest thing to it, right?", "completion": "Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --"}
{"prompt": "Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?", "completion": "The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop."}
{"prompt": "I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?", "completion": "Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me."}
{"prompt": "And the problem is you only got three.", "completion": "No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up."}
{"prompt": "Well, he's a good soldier.", "completion": "The exercise was one of his Section Eight \"private sessions\". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning."}
{"prompt": "It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.", "completion": "A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country."}
{"prompt": "And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?", "completion": "The official term for it is \"Clusterfuck\". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant..."}
{"prompt": "Tell me what I can do.", "completion": "This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator."}
{"prompt": "That bad?", "completion": "Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --"}
{"prompt": "Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --", "completion": "What kind of trouble are you in?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.", "completion": "How are you?"}
{"prompt": "In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.", "completion": "He was your friend."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Your phone number?"}
{"prompt": "A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.", "completion": "I should probably write that down."}
{"prompt": "Nah.", "completion": "Want company?"}
{"prompt": "Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.", "completion": "Think it'll work?"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing out here?", "completion": "Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "Do I have a choice in this?", "completion": "Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself."}
{"prompt": "West?", "completion": "Nobody saw. But I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "Really.", "completion": "Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past."}
{"prompt": "There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.", "completion": "You're a good man, Hardy."}
{"prompt": "Tough.", "completion": "That's not true."}
{"prompt": "This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.", "completion": "What if I don't want it?"}
{"prompt": "Seven guys. What was it you said? You were \"just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said\".", "completion": "This isn't the time --"}
{"prompt": "Seven.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "No death certificates. No crime.", "completion": "We need to talk --"}
{"prompt": "WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?", "completion": "No bodies, no West..."}
{"prompt": "We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --", "completion": "Hardy, for Chrissakes --"}
{"prompt": "Hardy, what are you doing --", "completion": "Isn't this how your story goes?"}
{"prompt": "We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.", "completion": "Right back where we started."}
{"prompt": "Four --", "completion": "Get in."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Good, just making sure."}
{"prompt": "We were close to something with Kendall.", "completion": "Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?"}
{"prompt": "For what?", "completion": "That's gonna stay my secret."}
{"prompt": "You know, you never told me why you left the army.", "completion": "It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out."}
{"prompt": "Think it'll work?", "completion": "Nah."}
{"prompt": "So what now?", "completion": "Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So did I."}
{"prompt": "You mean the falsely accused?", "completion": "You wanted to break him."}
{"prompt": "You wanted to get the truth.", "completion": "No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy."}
{"prompt": "You couldn't have known --", "completion": "Yeah, I could've. Should've."}
{"prompt": "See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --", "completion": "I pushed him too hard."}
{"prompt": "Good idea.", "completion": "That's a fantastic idea --"}
{"prompt": "Positive. Hardy, they planned this.", "completion": "Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?"}
{"prompt": "What Kendall said -- \"the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around.\" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.", "completion": "Are you sure?"}
{"prompt": "They got their stories straight.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Let's go talk to Bill...", "completion": "We're fucked, I know --"}
{"prompt": "That bugs you too?", "completion": "Little bit."}
{"prompt": "And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.", "completion": "So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?"}
{"prompt": "Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --", "completion": "Buttfucks the cabin?"}
{"prompt": "And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.", "completion": "So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --"}
{"prompt": "Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.", "completion": "They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent."}
{"prompt": "And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.", "completion": "Dunbar."}
{"prompt": "What happened next?", "completion": "Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike."}
{"prompt": "Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.", "completion": "At least you and Kendall agree on that."}
{"prompt": "I didn't shoot West...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you care?", "completion": "Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy."}
{"prompt": "Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my \"great second chance\", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --", "completion": "But you will."}
{"prompt": "Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?", "completion": "I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --"}
{"prompt": "West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.", "completion": "You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --"}
{"prompt": "Watch me.", "completion": "You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?"}
{"prompt": "You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.", "completion": "Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --", "completion": "Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?"}
{"prompt": "Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.", "completion": "Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed."}
{"prompt": "That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.", "completion": "I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder."}
{"prompt": "\"Too neat.\" How long have you been an investigator?", "completion": "I don't think that has anything to do with --"}
{"prompt": "But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --", "completion": "I lied. Wait for it..."}
{"prompt": "That was kid gloves?", "completion": "Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight."}
{"prompt": "Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.", "completion": "Got it."}
{"prompt": "Being back here. Gives me the willies.", "completion": "Not the happiest of memories?"}
{"prompt": "What point?", "completion": "Something wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?", "completion": "He's telling the truth, up to a point."}
{"prompt": "So noted.", "completion": "You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here."}
{"prompt": "I plan to grow on you.", "completion": "You're off to a late start."}
{"prompt": "The very same.", "completion": "You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.", "completion": "This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "I lost a bet.", "completion": "You're kidding."}
{"prompt": "You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.", "completion": "Something like that. You?"}
{"prompt": "Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.", "completion": "Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up."}
{"prompt": "Best time for banal chit-chat.", "completion": "What is that?"}
{"prompt": "You're right. We should sit in silence.", "completion": "We're in the middle of a murder case --"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.", "completion": "You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?"}
{"prompt": "I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --", "completion": "You made me look like an idiot --"}
{"prompt": "See, Ray, this is what we call \"good cop, bad cop\". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.", "completion": "Baseball?"}
{"prompt": "Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.", "completion": "The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --"}
{"prompt": "Something like that.", "completion": "I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.", "completion": "Good cop/bad cop?"}
{"prompt": "That is the most unprofessional --", "completion": "Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me?", "completion": "Is Dunbar cute?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Move him."}
{"prompt": "Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.", "completion": "He's in interrogation?"}
{"prompt": "Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.", "completion": "Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --"}
{"prompt": "Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --", "completion": "Levi? Who names their kid Levi --"}
{"prompt": "Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?", "completion": "Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys."}
{"prompt": "It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --", "completion": "Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this."}
{"prompt": "He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.", "completion": "You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres."}
{"prompt": "Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --", "completion": "You and the Colonel go back."}
{"prompt": "Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.", "completion": "And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore."}
{"prompt": "He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.", "completion": "I didn't mean that as a compliment."}
{"prompt": "Ah, Christ", "completion": "You knew Sergeant West?"}
{"prompt": "Hostile and uncooperative.", "completion": "Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Pike, please --", "completion": "Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --"}
{"prompt": "I don't think I want to hear this --", "completion": "Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right."}
{"prompt": "How?", "completion": "Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --"}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero."}
{"prompt": "To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --", "completion": "The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --"}
{"prompt": "I was freezing from the hurricane --", "completion": "So you took off your shirt?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, you remember now --", "completion": "I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah and he doesn't know when --", "completion": "I remember now, it was before the explosion --"}
{"prompt": "You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --", "completion": "Pike and I got separated --"}
{"prompt": "They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --", "completion": "Poor fucker my ass..."}
{"prompt": "We should tell him we're not going.", "completion": "Oh, yeah, \"Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on.\" He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland."}
{"prompt": "You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?", "completion": "You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe we shouldn't go.", "completion": "The faggot speaks."}
{"prompt": "What happened with Nunez?", "completion": "He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him..."}
{"prompt": "I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --", "completion": "So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike."}
{"prompt": "Childs.", "completion": "I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished."}
{"prompt": "We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.", "completion": "Who, Levi --"}
{"prompt": "Dunbar's telling the truth.", "completion": "Wrong answer --"}
{"prompt": "Wait --", "completion": "What."}
{"prompt": "It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!", "completion": "Enjoy your flight to Washington --"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "It won't work --"}
{"prompt": "You can't threaten me --", "completion": "It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --"}
{"prompt": "Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --", "completion": "You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --"}
{"prompt": "No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.", "completion": "Dunbar says you were."}
{"prompt": "Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?", "completion": "Pike never confessed."}
{"prompt": "Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?", "completion": "Fifty minutes."}
{"prompt": "Pike never confessed.", "completion": "We've been making progress, I see."}
{"prompt": "But you didn't see it, right?", "completion": "Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone."}
{"prompt": "Nunez was chasing Dunbar.", "completion": "Because he'd shot Mueller."}
{"prompt": "No one else heard it?", "completion": "He whispered it in my ear."}
{"prompt": "He said what?", "completion": "\"You're gonna die tonight, faggot\". Clear as day."}
{"prompt": "He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.", "completion": "He wanted more than that."}
{"prompt": "We just want --", "completion": "What, \"The Truth\"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem."}
{"prompt": "Tell him to shut up --", "completion": "-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --"}

{"prompt": "You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --", "completion": "Bullshit --"}
{"prompt": "Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --", "completion": "The fuck are you talking about --"}
{"prompt": "Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --", "completion": "We're not going anywhere."}
{"prompt": "I used it to start the fire --", "completion": "Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?"}
{"prompt": "We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --", "completion": "Where's your shirt, Mueller?"}
{"prompt": "This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --", "completion": "Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose."}
{"prompt": "Thank God...", "completion": "What the fuck are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --", "completion": "Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --"}
{"prompt": "What the fuck happened to you --", "completion": "What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --"}
{"prompt": "Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?", "completion": "Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit."}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black."}
{"prompt": "No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --", "completion": "You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right."}
{"prompt": "Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.", "completion": "Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning."}
{"prompt": "Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "You never told me why you got kicked out of...", "completion": "The army kicked you out for drugs..."}
{"prompt": "What happens to Dunbar now?", "completion": "Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out."}
{"prompt": "We know.", "completion": "I'm giving you a chance to walk away."}
{"prompt": "He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.", "completion": "You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore."}
{"prompt": "It's too neat.", "completion": "You want Kendall, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "No --", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --", "completion": "You think he did it?"}
{"prompt": "Then it's unofficial.", "completion": "Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time..."}
{"prompt": "He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.", "completion": "He's not Army, it's not official --"}
{"prompt": "He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.", "completion": "But this guy you called, he's not even Army --"}
{"prompt": "LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!", "completion": "This is totally unnecessary --"}
{"prompt": "Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?", "completion": "Sir, yes, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, yes, sir!", "completion": "So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, yes, sir!", "completion": "In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, yes, sir!", "completion": "Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Good luck, kid.", "completion": "You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.", "completion": "There's only one I want."}
{"prompt": "A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.", "completion": "That would explain the indigestion."}
{"prompt": "I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.", "completion": "Didn't kill anything, did I?"}
{"prompt": "I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.", "completion": "Sorry, kid. I don't do charity."}
{"prompt": "Someone stole my backpack.", "completion": "Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there."}
{"prompt": "Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.", "completion": "I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!"}
{"prompt": "Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.", "completion": "What do you mean? You don't even know me."}
{"prompt": "I know her uncle. Friends of the family.", "completion": "Who is she? Where does she live?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.", "completion": "I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone."}
{"prompt": "See! The big guy likes it.", "completion": "I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her."}
{"prompt": "Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.", "completion": "That's great."}
{"prompt": "Great, great. That's fantastic.", "completion": "It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost."}
{"prompt": "You won't find a better place!", "completion": "I don't expect to."}
{"prompt": "This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.", "completion": "No one's ever left."}
{"prompt": "I have to leave. Tonight.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.", "completion": "It truly is."}
{"prompt": "He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.", "completion": "No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late."}
{"prompt": "The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.", "completion": "The poet? What ever happened to him?"}
{"prompt": "Not yet.", "completion": "What is this place?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.", "completion": "You were expecting me?"}
{"prompt": "Bloom like a flower?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Welcome to ya. What's your name?", "completion": "Edward Bloom."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!", "completion": "I didn't know she belonged to anybody."}
{"prompt": "Bloom!", "completion": "Don."}
{"prompt": "I brought it.", "completion": "Let's see it."}
{"prompt": "Fine, I'm doing it.", "completion": "You get the eye?"}
{"prompt": "Fine, I will.", "completion": "Fine, you do it."}
{"prompt": "I'll go in right now and get that eye.", "completion": "Then do it."}
{"prompt": "Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.", "completion": "Or are you too scared?"}
{"prompt": "Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?", "completion": "A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish."}
{"prompt": "How would you describe him?", "completion": "Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?"}
{"prompt": "How long have you known my father?", "completion": "Thirty years. Maybe more."}
{"prompt": "Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.", "completion": "My father and I have an advantage. We never talk."}
{"prompt": "Can I see him?", "completion": "Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.", "completion": "A pleasure."}

{"prompt": "I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.", "completion": "I see. I thank you for your time."}
{"prompt": "You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.", "completion": "I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference."}
{"prompt": "I'm not convinced you should be happy.", "completion": "I'm sorry. Have I offended you?"}
{"prompt": "It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.", "completion": "Helping people makes me happy."}
{"prompt": "In so many words, yes.", "completion": "Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time."}
{"prompt": "So I've heard.", "completion": "I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word."}
{"prompt": "No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.", "completion": "Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety."}
{"prompt": "You must be Edward Bloom.", "completion": "How did you know?"}
{"prompt": "Promise me you'll come back.", "completion": "I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to."}
{"prompt": "How are you gonna make it without your shoes?", "completion": "I suspect it will hurt a lot."}
{"prompt": "You're pretty good at arithmetic.", "completion": "And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all."}
{"prompt": "Eighteen.", "completion": "I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38."}
{"prompt": "It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.", "completion": "How old are you?"}
{"prompt": "Was she nekkid?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What did she look like?", "completion": "Well, she... uh..."}
{"prompt": "And I like you.", "completion": "Did you see that woman?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.", "completion": "I like your stories."}
{"prompt": "There was one time when I was eleven...", "completion": "You were talking about your wedding."}
{"prompt": "Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?", "completion": "Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why."}
{"prompt": "I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.", "completion": "Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication."}
{"prompt": "Oh, so this is a tall tale?", "completion": "Well, it's not a short one."}
{"prompt": "I never knew.", "completion": "Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor."}
{"prompt": "Please?", "completion": "That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else."}
{"prompt": "Can I take your picture?", "completion": "You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary."}
{"prompt": "They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.", "completion": "Spooning the sherbet."}
{"prompt": "He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.", "completion": "Stop."}
{"prompt": "No, I understand.", "completion": "He was slipping her a little extra cream."}
{"prompt": "Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, \"Your Grampa is going to die.\" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.", "completion": "Because see, my mother was banging the milkman."}
{"prompt": "Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, \"Your Aunt is going to die.\" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.", "completion": "That's terrible."}
{"prompt": "I was dreaming.", "completion": "What were you dreaming about?"}
{"prompt": "You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.", "completion": "Hi. How are you feeling?"}
{"prompt": "Just to be sure, you can take my pack.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.", "completion": "You're not trying to run away?"}
{"prompt": "Beats me.", "completion": "You know anyone's who's taken it?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "What did she say?"}
{"prompt": "I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.", "completion": "You don't like it?"}
{"prompt": "What's your name, Giant?", "completion": "Karl."}
{"prompt": "So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.", "completion": "You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here."}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?", "completion": "I can."}
{"prompt": "Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.", "completion": "Yes. Exactly."}
{"prompt": "It's unbelievable.", "completion": "Story of my life."}
{"prompt": "You say...", "completion": "The River!"}
{"prompt": "Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...", "completion": "Where are we headed?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. Okay.", "completion": "Let's get out of here."}
{"prompt": "I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.", "completion": "Like this."}
{"prompt": "How what happens?", "completion": "How I go."}
{"prompt": "The river?", "completion": "Tell me how it happens."}
{"prompt": "I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.", "completion": "The river."}
{"prompt": "What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?", "completion": "Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once."}
{"prompt": "Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.", "completion": "It would kill you, huh?"}
{"prompt": "You think I'm fake.", "completion": "Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen."}
{"prompt": "I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.", "completion": "You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake."}
{"prompt": "What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?", "completion": "I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact."}
{"prompt": "Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, \"The thing about icebergs is...\"", "completion": "The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'm trying to make a metaphor here."}
{"prompt": "Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.", "completion": "Dad!"}
{"prompt": "Can we talk?", "completion": "Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?"}
{"prompt": "Dad?", "completion": "Son?"}
{"prompt": "I think someone hasn't.", "completion": "But the real story is how I got the car. You see..."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, so you know.", "completion": "Did I ever tell you about how..."}
{"prompt": "It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.", "completion": "Josephine actually went to the Congo last year."}
{"prompt": "I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.", "completion": "Why not religion, Dad?"}
{"prompt": "I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.", "completion": "I thought you weren't dying."}
{"prompt": "I will.", "completion": "You know where the chemicals are?"}
{"prompt": "I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.", "completion": "Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could..."}
{"prompt": "Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.", "completion": "You mean, while I'm here."}
{"prompt": "There's a lot you don't know about me.", "completion": "You're right."}
{"prompt": "True story.", "completion": "When did you ever work in an office?"}
{"prompt": "You owe me three-fifty.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?", "completion": "What did he say?"}
{"prompt": "There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "So how does it happen?", "completion": "Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you."}
{"prompt": "No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.", "completion": "I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens."}
{"prompt": "The Old Lady by the swamp.", "completion": "She was a witch."}
{"prompt": "Really.", "completion": "Truly. I saw it in The Eye."}
{"prompt": "You learned from the best.", "completion": "People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go."}
{"prompt": "No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.", "completion": "You think I'm up for it?"}
{"prompt": "Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...", "completion": "Did you do any of that?"}
{"prompt": "You --  -- are in for a surprise.", "completion": "Am I?"}
{"prompt": "Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.", "completion": "I'm not scared."}
{"prompt": "No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?", "completion": "The one about the witch."}
{"prompt": "Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?", "completion": "Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story."}
{"prompt": "I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.", "completion": "Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Make him stop.", "completion": "What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?"}
{"prompt": "I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.", "completion": "You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish."}
{"prompt": "Go out with me.", "completion": "I was drying out."}
{"prompt": "I have the rest of my life to find out.", "completion": "How can I convince you to stop?"}
{"prompt": "I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.", "completion": "You don't even know me."}
{"prompt": "They're your favorite flower.", "completion": "How did you get so many?"}
{"prompt": "But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.", "completion": "Daffodils?"}
{"prompt": "Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "This is it? The whole vault.", "completion": "'Fraid so."}
{"prompt": "So what are you up to now?", "completion": "I'm robbing this place."}
{"prompt": "I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.", "completion": "That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped."}
{"prompt": "I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.", "completion": "I don't believe it!"}
{"prompt": "You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.", "completion": "It's me. Norther Winslow."}
{"prompt": "Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?", "completion": "I can't imagine any place better than here."}
{"prompt": "There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.", "completion": "This is why you don't show work in progress."}
{"prompt": "I've been working on this poem for 12 years.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "Wait! I need those!", "completion": "There is no softer ground than town."}
{"prompt": "You didn't become crazy.", "completion": "Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale."}
{"prompt": "Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.", "completion": "No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else."}
{"prompt": "Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.", "completion": "My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two."}
{"prompt": "Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?", "completion": "Because he's dying."}
{"prompt": "Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.", "completion": "I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof."}
{"prompt": "This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.", "completion": "Were you and my father having an affair?"}
{"prompt": "I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.", "completion": "How did you know my father?"}
{"prompt": "I wasn't expecting you.", "completion": "Are you Jenny Hill?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. Oh.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "I do.", "completion": "I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking."}
{"prompt": "I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.", "completion": "Do you like it, being pregnant?"}
{"prompt": "I need to lie down for a bit.", "completion": "I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to..."}
{"prompt": "I'll help you.", "completion": "I'm going to check on him."}
{"prompt": "We'll have to pick up a copy.", "completion": "I'm going to get started on dishes."}
{"prompt": "Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.", "completion": "I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. I'll bet you need to --", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.", "completion": "Is he going to be okay?"}
{"prompt": "I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "You're not.", "completion": "I need you on my side."}
{"prompt": "What is \"true?\" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.", "completion": "Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy."}
{"prompt": "You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.", "completion": "But it's not true."}
{"prompt": "Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.", "completion": "Do you love him?"}
{"prompt": "Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.", "completion": "Do you love your father?"}
{"prompt": "Mmm.", "completion": "Mmm, what?"}
{"prompt": "That's because most of it never happened.", "completion": "But it's romantic."}
{"prompt": "They met at Auburn.", "completion": "What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that."}
{"prompt": "Did you?", "completion": "You never told me how your parents met."}
{"prompt": "I'm going with you.", "completion": "I talked with your father last night."}
{"prompt": "I'm going with you.", "completion": "You don't have to."}
{"prompt": "You need to go.", "completion": "Probably tonight."}
{"prompt": "It's bad.", "completion": "It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo."}
{"prompt": "Mom, do you want some time with Dad?", "completion": "Yes. Thank you."}
{"prompt": "I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.", "completion": "That's okay?"}
{"prompt": "Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.", "completion": "I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there."}
{"prompt": "I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.", "completion": "So you never bought any land."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Did you and Dad have any other property?"}
{"prompt": "He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.", "completion": "Mom?"}
{"prompt": "Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.", "completion": "Is he awake?"}
{"prompt": "Do you know who that is?", "completion": "That really happened?"}
{"prompt": "Was she one of your teachers?", "completion": "No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me."}
{"prompt": "Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.", "completion": "Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair."}
{"prompt": "But I understand you, Mom. I always have.", "completion": "Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now."}
{"prompt": "True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.", "completion": "I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all."}
{"prompt": "Josephine and I have a lot in common.", "completion": "Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that."}
{"prompt": "Yes. But that's a different...", "completion": "No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.", "completion": "Would you say you understand Josephine?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?"}
{"prompt": "Really! That's wonderful.", "completion": "Mom, would you say you understand Dad?"}
{"prompt": "You don't talk about those things. Not yet.", "completion": "I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek."}
{"prompt": "He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.", "completion": "How much time does he have left?"}
{"prompt": "He's up with your father.", "completion": "How is he?"}
{"prompt": "You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.", "completion": "Is that Dr. Bennett's car?"}
{"prompt": "Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.", "completion": "We rented a car."}
{"prompt": "How did you get here?", "completion": "We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really."}
{"prompt": "The sets were good.", "completion": "The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever."}
{"prompt": "Yeah it was okay.", "completion": "Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked."}
{"prompt": "Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff", "completion": "I paid for those guitar cases."}
{"prompt": "Such as?", "completion": "When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?"}
{"prompt": "I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.", "completion": "I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week."}
{"prompt": "You know what for.", "completion": "No I don't."}
{"prompt": "Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me \ufffd150.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "You first.", "completion": "Fifty thousand. Almost exactly."}
{"prompt": "You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.", "completion": "No I haven't."}
{"prompt": "What. You're what? You're with this creep now.", "completion": "Leave him!"}
{"prompt": "What? What are you doing?", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?", "completion": "Name it."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks."}
{"prompt": "Say thank you.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Do you like it?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "That's not a burn.", "completion": "It is. I did it cooking."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "It's nothing. I burnt myself."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "We'll stop then."}
{"prompt": "You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.", "completion": "Do you want to stop?"}
{"prompt": "It's enough isn't it?", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.", "completion": "There's over eighty thousand here."}
{"prompt": "I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Uh... Yes.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "You can see why it's sensitive?"}
{"prompt": "Ch...", "completion": "To customers approaching the bank from the rear"}
{"prompt": "Leave her alone.", "completion": "This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression."}
{"prompt": "Just leave her alone.", "completion": "I'm so sorry."}
{"prompt": "He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.", "completion": "Oh Jesus. Of course I can't."}
{"prompt": "I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.", "completion": "Oh Jesus."}
{"prompt": "I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.", "completion": "You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank."}
{"prompt": "I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...", "completion": "He wants the money from your bank."}
{"prompt": "Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.", "completion": "He wants a lot of money."}
{"prompt": "What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?", "completion": "He wants money."}
{"prompt": "What did he say? Tell me!", "completion": "He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.", "completion": "What? What does he want?"}
{"prompt": "John.", "completion": "Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him."}
{"prompt": "Good night.", "completion": "Put the fucking kettle down."}
{"prompt": "You can stay tonight.", "completion": "I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone."}
{"prompt": "To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.", "completion": "I understand. I'm so sorry"}
{"prompt": "How is bank?", "completion": "Fine. I thought you were leaving today."}
{"prompt": "I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.", "completion": "It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something."}
{"prompt": "No. It's not that.", "completion": "Do you believe in love?"}
{"prompt": "He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.", "completion": "You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love."}
{"prompt": "No. It is too judgmental.", "completion": "Tell me what he said."}
{"prompt": "Oh nothing.", "completion": "Tell me."}
{"prompt": "Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.", "completion": "What was that?"}
{"prompt": "\"I have these uh...\" She explains to you... \"When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses.\" Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.", "completion": "Binoculars."}
{"prompt": "\"I saw you waiting there, by the gate.\"", "completion": "I..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "When?"}
{"prompt": "Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'", "completion": "She says she has a secret to tell."}
{"prompt": "She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!", "completion": "Uh. Do you like England?"}
{"prompt": "You're asking for my documents?", "completion": "No, no..."}
{"prompt": "Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.", "completion": "You must have a visa or something..."}
{"prompt": "Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.", "completion": "So how long will you be in England?"}
{"prompt": "What was that?", "completion": "I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you."}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Right. So I can say he smokes me. So."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "We better watch him. He's crazy."}
{"prompt": "So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?", "completion": "Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem."}
{"prompt": "Hold on.", "completion": "Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us."}
{"prompt": "And...", "completion": "And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you."}
{"prompt": "Yes. I know.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "I need to know who you are first please.", "completion": "Oh.  We are Russian."}
{"prompt": "What did he say?", "completion": "He says he feels safe here."}
{"prompt": "I'm asking what you're here for.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing here?", "completion": "Sorry. You've lost me..."}
{"prompt": "Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?", "completion": "You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates."}
{"prompt": "Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.", "completion": "How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "My name's Sophia."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you will find out.", "completion": "Hurry. I'll wait for you here."}
{"prompt": "Tell me about it.", "completion": "What does it mean?"}
{"prompt": "It's more like a date.", "completion": "It's a long way to go for a date."}
{"prompt": "I'm not asking you to marry me.", "completion": "No. What? No. I know."}
{"prompt": "It's what you came back for.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "It's not mine.", "completion": "It's not mine either."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "Please."}
{"prompt": "You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.", "completion": "Whatever."}
{"prompt": "I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.", "completion": "Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Promise?", "completion": "You can probably buy them on the flight."}
{"prompt": "Goodbye.", "completion": "Something else."}
{"prompt": "Because it was a lie.", "completion": "Okay. Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. No thanks.", "completion": "Please. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. Thank you.", "completion": "Whatever."}
{"prompt": "I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?", "completion": "No. I think I better just go."}
{"prompt": "You know you can come under the blanket.", "completion": "It's alright."}
{"prompt": "What was her name?", "completion": "What's your name?"}
{"prompt": "Except for Small Eyes.", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "I don't want anyone to die.", "completion": "Except for Small Eyes."}
{"prompt": "Nobody's that unhappy.", "completion": "Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?"}
{"prompt": "I've got news for you. It's not working.", "completion": "I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy."}
{"prompt": "You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.", "completion": "I'm trying to quit."}
{"prompt": "She's alive!! She is not dead?", "completion": "Laugh it up."}
{"prompt": "I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.", "completion": "She's alive?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "She's dead.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.", "completion": "Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard."}
{"prompt": "Not really. Maybe a little.", "completion": "What happened between you and the blonde?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Are you scared?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Have you had any before?"}
{"prompt": "Well what have you got?", "completion": "Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?"}
{"prompt": "I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.", "completion": "I don't have nothing."}
{"prompt": "Thank Christ for that.", "completion": "You are pretty naive if you think it is."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.", "completion": "The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans."}
{"prompt": "Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?", "completion": "Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong."}
{"prompt": "Please, there's no... Oh.", "completion": "I wasn't saying anything."}
{"prompt": "You don't have to say anything", "completion": "What? I... I wasn't saying..."}
{"prompt": "Get out.", "completion": "You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world."}
{"prompt": "Get out", "completion": "You are throwing me out."}
{"prompt": "You don't understand you either.", "completion": "Excuse me?"}
{"prompt": "So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?", "completion": "You don't understand me."}
{"prompt": "You didn't mind too much.", "completion": "It wasn't what I wanted."}
{"prompt": "You...", "completion": "I got what I paid for."}
{"prompt": "Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "So now you hate all women?", "completion": "I think it's my safest bet, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.", "completion": "I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes neither.", "completion": "Some... What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "Sometimes.", "completion": "Sometimes which?"}
{"prompt": "Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.", "completion": "So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?"}
{"prompt": "So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..", "completion": "Whereas \"Wet 'n' Wild\" is an emotional journey. \"Tied and Tethered\". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina."}
{"prompt": "And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.", "completion": "What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly."}
{"prompt": "And. It's wrong.", "completion": "And who says what is wrong."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.", "completion": "And? What are you saying?"}
{"prompt": "So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?", "completion": "I don't hate you."}
{"prompt": "Okay we won't talk about it.", "completion": "We'll pretend it never happened."}
{"prompt": "You don't want to talk about it.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Shut up. I'm not listening."}
{"prompt": "No. But you tend to tie them up.", "completion": "I don't want to talk about it."}
{"prompt": "He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.", "completion": "Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too."}
{"prompt": "He will come back.", "completion": "Excuse me?"}
{"prompt": "But, you know, so what?", "completion": "Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed."}
{"prompt": "If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.", "completion": "Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.", "completion": "Oh Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.", "completion": "So uh..."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "It's none of your business."}
{"prompt": "So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...", "completion": "I don't want to talk about him."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I said I don't have any."}
{"prompt": "Give me some money.", "completion": "I don't have any money."}
{"prompt": "Shut up. Have you got your passport?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Have you got your passport?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?", "completion": "You don't have to do this. I can look after myself."}
{"prompt": "What? No you're not..", "completion": "I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'm going to be sick. Where's the..."}
{"prompt": "Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.", "completion": "Where's the restroom?"}
{"prompt": "In every sense. If at all possible.", "completion": "You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already."}
{"prompt": "I do. I want to very badly.", "completion": "So you're just going to be vindictive"}
{"prompt": "In the world.", "completion": "I know you just want to punish me --"}
{"prompt": "You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.", "completion": "No I don't."}
{"prompt": "Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.", "completion": "Well as it turns out I did."}
{"prompt": "They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.", "completion": "Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me."}
{"prompt": "So what are you going to do?", "completion": "I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison."}
{"prompt": "It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.", "completion": "That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy."}
{"prompt": "It's makes it easier. Okay.", "completion": "I don't want to know."}
{"prompt": "I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.", "completion": "Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.", "completion": "You don't understand anything."}
{"prompt": "Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.", "completion": "They go."}
{"prompt": "What's wrong?", "completion": "They go."}
{"prompt": "Yes I know.", "completion": "They go. John. They go."}
{"prompt": "Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.", "completion": "\"Frenzy\"."}
{"prompt": "Syevodnya?", "completion": "Syevodnya"}
{"prompt": "I don't understand.", "completion": "Happy bath day."}
{"prompt": "Today is bath day.", "completion": "Sorry?"}
{"prompt": "Uh... Are you a giraffe?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Do you follow or should I speak slower?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Good. Or should I speak slower?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "So. Is it different to how you imagined it?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I mean... \"Ants.\" \"I've got a problem with ants.\""}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I'm pretty nervous. Are you?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it."}
{"prompt": "Right. Okay. Good.", "completion": "It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand \"ants\"?"}
{"prompt": "Is that everything?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "How do you want to pay?", "completion": "Cash."}
{"prompt": "You have excellent English.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.", "completion": "Please check. Is it full? Please could you check."}
{"prompt": "Yes, ma'am.", "completion": "Is the flight full?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know.", "completion": "Then start taking them seriously."}
{"prompt": "Just wanted to see.", "completion": "You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "I do. God's truth. I do.", "completion": "What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.", "completion": "Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?"}
{"prompt": "I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...", "completion": "Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me..."}
{"prompt": "More cough syrup?", "completion": "Can I come in?"}
{"prompt": "What do you need?", "completion": "I need ya help again."}
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over."}
{"prompt": "When? Now? Oh. No.", "completion": "Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy."}
{"prompt": "Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...", "completion": "You gonna sing me somethin'?"}
{"prompt": "I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.", "completion": "At church?"}
{"prompt": "That'd be nice.", "completion": "I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?"}
{"prompt": "You liked what I brung ya?", "completion": "Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo."}
{"prompt": "Well. Hope you enjoy it.", "completion": "I bet you have loyal customers."}
{"prompt": "Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.", "completion": "This was very sweet of you."}
{"prompt": "You didn't have to do this.", "completion": "Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank."}

{"prompt": "You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?", "completion": "Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby."}
{"prompt": "Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?", "completion": "I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this."}
{"prompt": "A naked woman, chained in ya house?", "completion": "I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home."}
{"prompt": "Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?", "completion": "Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done."}
{"prompt": "Or what?", "completion": "I told you to TURN BACK!"}
{"prompt": "Ain't gonna be moved?", "completion": "Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say..."}
{"prompt": "You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?", "completion": "You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this."}
{"prompt": "Goin' dove huntin'?", "completion": "You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time."}
{"prompt": "This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.", "completion": "Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days."}
{"prompt": "R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.", "completion": "You get a call from Rose?"}
{"prompt": "He's fine. Just had a bad fall.", "completion": "Why's his britches round his knees?"}
{"prompt": "He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.", "completion": "Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?"}
{"prompt": "I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.", "completion": "Don't know if God wanna see me."}
{"prompt": "Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.", "completion": "You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?"}
{"prompt": "That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.", "completion": "I didn't start this, R.L."}
{"prompt": "You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.", "completion": "I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her."}
{"prompt": "I skipped lunch.", "completion": "Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat."}
{"prompt": "Yes'sir.", "completion": "You struck some gold, didn't ya?"}
{"prompt": "My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?", "completion": "So...  That your first time?"}

{"prompt": "What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.", "completion": "Why she got a chain on her?"}
{"prompt": "Keep the change on that.", "completion": "Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said."}

{"prompt": "Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.", "completion": "You won't at the square this mornin'."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.", "completion": "It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else."}
{"prompt": "What's on your mind?", "completion": "You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch."}
{"prompt": "You could put it that way.", "completion": "But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven."}
{"prompt": "So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?", "completion": "You a preacher?"}
{"prompt": "I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?", "completion": "You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me."}
{"prompt": "Ronnie...", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?", "completion": "Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!"}

{"prompt": "I feel better. Do you?", "completion": "Yeah, I do."}

{"prompt": "No. I just got a messed up stomach.", "completion": "Holy shit!"}
{"prompt": "Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.", "completion": "Are you wasted?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know.", "completion": "I think it'd be better if you talk to me."}
{"prompt": "You feelin' sick?", "completion": "I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get."}
{"prompt": "You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...", "completion": "I think if I just piss... I'll be okay."}
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "Hey."}
{"prompt": "It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!", "completion": "Rae!"}

{"prompt": "This ain't gonna work.", "completion": "Rae..."}
{"prompt": "But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...", "completion": "Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...", "completion": "All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that."}
{"prompt": "The hell are you talkin' about?", "completion": "Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had."}
{"prompt": "All that shit's on aisle 5.", "completion": "I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all."}
{"prompt": "I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?", "completion": "I just wanted some make-up."}
{"prompt": "You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.", "completion": "Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?"}
{"prompt": "You need money again?", "completion": "No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want."}
{"prompt": "What happened to your face?", "completion": "Got in a little accident."}
{"prompt": "Didn't know you was workin' here now?", "completion": "I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?"}
{"prompt": "The hell you call me?", "completion": "Eh, if the bootie fits..."}
{"prompt": "Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.", "completion": "Alright. How much you need, ho?"}
{"prompt": "Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.", "completion": "Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?"}
{"prompt": "Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.", "completion": "What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now."}
{"prompt": "I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.", "completion": "What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me."}

{"prompt": "He couldn't find his ass with both hands.", "completion": "Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on."}
{"prompt": "I don't think he'd feel it.", "completion": "... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him."}
{"prompt": "Maybe we should bail?", "completion": "It's incredible.  Hit him or something."}
{"prompt": "Getting very weird.", "completion": "I'd feel better if we had some heat."}
{"prompt": "This the right place?", "completion": "I hope not."}
{"prompt": "This should be it...", "completion": "You said that in the last two places."}
{"prompt": "Let's grab some food.", "completion": "First decent idea you've had."}
{"prompt": "I said let's go, Charlie.", "completion": "... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.", "completion": "Nick, we can't just --"}

{"prompt": "I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.", "completion": "Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat."}

{"prompt": "He was my partner.", "completion": "They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!"}
{"prompt": "They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.", "completion": "It's not your job."}
{"prompt": "Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.", "completion": "Why me?"}
{"prompt": "You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.", "completion": "What...?  What if I say no?"}
{"prompt": "He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective."}
{"prompt": "The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.", "completion": "One guy do all the damage?"}
{"prompt": "Dope?", "completion": "Not in that company."}
{"prompt": "How big a package we talking about?", "completion": "This by this..."}
{"prompt": "I have to get to Sugai.", "completion": "Goodbye, officer."}
{"prompt": "If anything happens to her while I'm here --", "completion": "-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them."}
{"prompt": "For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!", "completion": "You had my help, detective."}
{"prompt": "Twenty-four hours, detective.", "completion": "Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you."}
{"prompt": "Look.", "completion": "Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!"}
{"prompt": "Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.", "completion": "While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch."}
{"prompt": "Can we skip the poetry, inspector?", "completion": "What's this?"}
{"prompt": "Because I want you to tell me.", "completion": "The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here."}
{"prompt": "Could you fill me in?", "completion": "Why don't you ask your chief detective?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.", "completion": "Do you know what this is?"}
{"prompt": "You're foreigners.", "completion": "Work with me.  I want your best detective."}
{"prompt": "It is not allowed.", "completion": "We're police officers."}
{"prompt": "Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.", "completion": "I want a gun."}
{"prompt": "After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.", "completion": "You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer."}
{"prompt": "That wasn't our deal.", "completion": "You want him dead too."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance."}
{"prompt": "You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.", "completion": "I don't have to."}
{"prompt": "Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.", "completion": "If I say no?"}
{"prompt": "I'll pay you.", "completion": "With these?"}
{"prompt": "The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.", "completion": "You trust me?"}
{"prompt": "Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?", "completion": "Why tell me this?"}
{"prompt": "Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.", "completion": "The Feds would be onto you in a month."}
{"prompt": "The families who control the casinos?", "completion": "Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them."}
{"prompt": "He'll be dealt with.", "completion": "Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us."}
{"prompt": "I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.", "completion": "I want him."}
{"prompt": "I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --", "completion": "-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant."}
{"prompt": "That wouldn't be very sporting.", "completion": "Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin."}
{"prompt": "One man.  He must be good.", "completion": "Then go get him."}
{"prompt": "Not to be trapped.", "completion": "You underestimate the trap, Mary."}
{"prompt": "Anywhere.", "completion": "What's the point?"}
{"prompt": "Let's go while there is still time.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.", "completion": "Pris?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.", "completion": "I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?"}
{"prompt": "He knows what he's doing.", "completion": "If he won't cooperate?"}
{"prompt": "You certainly have a nice place here.", "completion": "Well stocked."}
{"prompt": "We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.", "completion": "We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost."}
{"prompt": "Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.", "completion": "Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along..."}
{"prompt": "I've done some questionable things.", "completion": "Also extraordinary things."}
{"prompt": "Also you're too valuable to experiment with.", "completion": "I am?"}
{"prompt": "But not to last.", "completion": "Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last."}
{"prompt": "Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.", "completion": "Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you."}
{"prompt": "What about E.M.S. recombination?", "completion": "We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks."}
{"prompt": "Come here.", "completion": "The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid that's a little out of my...", "completion": "I want more life, fucker."}
{"prompt": "What's the problem?", "completion": "Death."}
{"prompt": "Would you like to be modified?", "completion": "Had in mind something a little more radical."}
{"prompt": "And what can he do for you?", "completion": "Can the maker repair what he makes?"}
{"prompt": "I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.", "completion": "It's not an easy thing to meet your maker."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.", "completion": "Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you."}
{"prompt": "The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.", "completion": "Oh?"}
{"prompt": "Just thought I'd...", "completion": "No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Where are you going, Sebastian?"}
{"prompt": "This afternoon.", "completion": "You're our best and only friend."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "When do you deliver your project?"}
{"prompt": "I'd be happy to mention it to him.", "completion": "Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to."}
{"prompt": "He could?", "completion": "His company made us."}
{"prompt": "He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.", "completion": "Tyrell could help us, Sebastian."}
{"prompt": "What about your friend, the man who owns this building?", "completion": "Dr. Tyrell?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.", "completion": "If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live."}
{"prompt": "Of course not.", "completion": "You could help us."}
{"prompt": "You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?", "completion": "Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet."}
{"prompt": "Like...", "completion": "We have a lot in common."}
{"prompt": "Show me something?", "completion": "Like what?"}
{"prompt": "What generation are you?", "completion": "Nexus - 6."}
{"prompt": "What, Sebastian?", "completion": "You're androids."}
{"prompt": "Why are you staring at us?", "completion": "You're just all so... so different."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.", "completion": "Well, actually"}
{"prompt": "How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.", "completion": "If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be..."}
{"prompt": "I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?", "completion": "Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor."}
{"prompt": "I want to do it.", "completion": "Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece."}
{"prompt": "I think, therefore I am.", "completion": "Very good, Pris.  Now show him why."}
{"prompt": "Then we're stupid and we'll die.", "completion": "Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?"}
{"prompt": "This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.", "completion": "Hello, glad to meet you."}
{"prompt": "When?", "completion": "Tomorrow, he says."}
{"prompt": "What's going on down there?", "completion": "He's not ready yet."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  I got it.", "completion": "Go."}
{"prompt": "Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.", "completion": "If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?"}
{"prompt": "Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.", "completion": "Got it."}
{"prompt": "She's not with you?", "completion": "Who."}
{"prompt": "This is Bryant.  Are you alone?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "You didn't like her!?", "completion": "Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin."}
{"prompt": "Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!", "completion": "I didn't like her."}
{"prompt": "If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.", "completion": "She was gonna get away."}
{"prompt": "Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.", "completion": "I was just about to have my dinner."}
{"prompt": "Garbage man?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What was the cover on the one that got Holden?", "completion": "Industrial refuse."}
{"prompt": "Where do we start?", "completion": "The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek."}
{"prompt": "You got a machine on it yet?", "completion": "We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city."}
{"prompt": "What was he after?", "completion": "There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one."}
{"prompt": "Six, huh?", "completion": "Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field."}
{"prompt": "Day after tomorrow.", "completion": "Oh!  Day after tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Soon as I finish the job.", "completion": "When might that be?"}
{"prompt": "Your customer, eh?", "completion": "Well, when do you get paid?"}
{"prompt": "Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.", "completion": "It's gotta be right for my customer."}
{"prompt": "Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.", "completion": "Number three."}
{"prompt": "Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.", "completion": "Next."}
{"prompt": "Longevity is classified.  No.", "completion": "Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females."}
{"prompt": "Four years.  Which would make her termination date...", "completion": "Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?"}
{"prompt": "And what in your estimation works?", "completion": "The umbrella."}
{"prompt": "Do you have something against science?", "completion": "Not if it works."}
{"prompt": "I think we're through for the night.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I know all that.", "completion": "What about a summary then."}
{"prompt": "I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.", "completion": "Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy."}
{"prompt": "Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,", "completion": "Okay, but..."}
{"prompt": "The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?", "completion": "How do I stop one?"}
{"prompt": "Why, yes, of course.", "completion": "You start."}
{"prompt": "This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.", "completion": "You equipped for random questions?"}
{"prompt": "Four years.", "completion": "Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?"}
{"prompt": "I gotta piss.", "completion": "How old am I?"}
{"prompt": "I like you too.", "completion": "One more, eh?"}
{"prompt": "No thanks.", "completion": "I like you."}
{"prompt": "Prosit.", "completion": "You like to kiss her goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.", "completion": "Prosit."}
{"prompt": "Ya.", "completion": "How long you had these guys?"}
{"prompt": "No problem.", "completion": "Those cockroaches?"}
{"prompt": "You want to see my friends?", "completion": "Sorry, don't have the time."}
{"prompt": "Prosit.", "completion": "Prosit."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much.", "completion": "My pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Vodka!", "completion": "Shot of vodka, please."}
{"prompt": "But I would like to buy you drink.", "completion": "I'll but you one.  What'll you have?"}
{"prompt": "I think I have no money.", "completion": "It's okay.  Forget it."}
{"prompt": "These aren't just...", "completion": "I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way."}
{"prompt": "I'm taking a piss.", "completion": "Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it."}
{"prompt": "I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "No.  I got a problem.", "completion": "Let's hear it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.", "completion": "Money?"}
{"prompt": "I'm doing okay.", "completion": "From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.", "completion": "Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee."}
{"prompt": "Me too.", "completion": "I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?"}
{"prompt": "But if you could?", "completion": "My job is here."}
{"prompt": "Why didn't you go?", "completion": "Too old."}
{"prompt": "You sure?", "completion": "Never been more sure of anything in my life."}
{"prompt": "What if you change your mind?", "completion": "They'll change the limit before I change my mind."}
{"prompt": "You're going to be over the limit.", "completion": "Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there."}
{"prompt": "But you haven't put in for emigration.", "completion": "Nope."}
{"prompt": "Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.", "completion": "True."}
{"prompt": "Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.", "completion": "Huh huh."}
{"prompt": "During the road test...", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Meaning?", "completion": "Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to."}
{"prompt": "No rust?", "completion": "I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time."}
{"prompt": "Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.", "completion": "Nerves of steel."}
{"prompt": "Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.", "completion": "What shows?"}
{"prompt": "You talking about the Opera House on the Main?", "completion": "Book the good ones for where?"}
{"prompt": "What's suck night?", "completion": "That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her."}
{"prompt": "What night?", "completion": "I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones."}
{"prompt": "The girl that doesn't look like that girl.", "completion": "Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night."}
{"prompt": "What did she want?", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Do you recognize any of them?", "completion": "This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but..."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?"}
{"prompt": "Can I come in?", "completion": "I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures."}
{"prompt": "Taffey Lewis?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Me.", "completion": "And who do I go to about you?"}
{"prompt": "I bet I would.", "completion": "Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress."}
{"prompt": "Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?", "completion": "You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body."}
{"prompt": "Jeezus!", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Does it eat?", "completion": "Come on."}
{"prompt": "You mean the snake.", "completion": "The best."}
{"prompt": "Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?", "completion": "It's a good job."}
{"prompt": "For holes.", "completion": "It that mother real?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.", "completion": "What the fuck for?"}
{"prompt": "Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?", "completion": "Are you for real?"}
{"prompt": "You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?", "completion": "How do you mean 'exploited'?"}
{"prompt": "There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.", "completion": "I don't know nothing about it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me."}
{"prompt": "Just wait here.", "completion": "You know what I think?"}
{"prompt": "Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.", "completion": "What difference will it make?"}
{"prompt": "Do you think I simulated what happened between us?", "completion": "No, I don't."}
{"prompt": "Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?", "completion": "Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it."}
{"prompt": "Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?", "completion": "Because it's not."}
{"prompt": "Ten years.", "completion": "Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.", "completion": "What's a long time?"}
{"prompt": "Have you ever known anybody a long time?", "completion": "You mean a woman?"}
{"prompt": "You're sick, Deckard.", "completion": "I never felt better."}
{"prompt": "This feels stupid.", "completion": "Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education."}
{"prompt": "But then how can you...", "completion": "I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect."}
{"prompt": "But if I don't plug it in how can I...", "completion": "Never mind the plug, just go through the motions."}
{"prompt": "They could clean around the arrangement.", "completion": "I don't like people snooping around my stuff."}
{"prompt": "Don't be fooled by appearances.", "completion": "It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?"}
{"prompt": "Hmmm?", "completion": "Have you ever cleaned your apartment?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?", "completion": "When was the last time you cleaned this place?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I think I missed something.", "completion": "Like?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.", "completion": "It wasn't very good last night, was it?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "That's another thing I can't do."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could.", "completion": "Did you cry when your father died?"}
{"prompt": "Do you dream?", "completion": "Yeah.  Sometimes."}
{"prompt": "What do people do in the afternoon?", "completion": "If they are smart, they take naps."}
{"prompt": "How are you doing?", "completion": "Not too good."}
{"prompt": "How come you're not on the job?", "completion": "I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out."}
{"prompt": "Dead.", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "Me and my dad.", "completion": "Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.", "completion": "Who is this?"}
{"prompt": "I told you I'd come back.", "completion": "You did?"}
{"prompt": "You ever take a bath with a man before?", "completion": "There's a lot I haven't done with a man before."}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to do?", "completion": "Sit."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite."}
{"prompt": "Can you?  I couldn't.", "completion": "They probably want to find out when they were made."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "I can imagine."}
{"prompt": "Do I make you nervous?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me."}
{"prompt": "I work alone.", "completion": "You use your equipment, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.", "completion": "Two of us might be more effective than one."}
{"prompt": "I think you need more help than you've got.", "completion": "There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it."}
{"prompt": "I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.", "completion": "I've already got more help than I need."}
{"prompt": "Ugh.", "completion": "Is there anything else?"}
{"prompt": "Sounds like you speaks from experience.", "completion": "Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters."}
{"prompt": "In your opinion.", "completion": "It would be my child."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "That would be murder, Mr. Deckard."}
{"prompt": "You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.", "completion": "I'd never get an abortion."}
{"prompt": "Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?", "completion": "You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug."}
{"prompt": "I'd kill it.", "completion": "In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl."}
{"prompt": "I'd take him to the doctor.", "completion": "You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.", "completion": "You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar."}
{"prompt": "Why should I be?", "completion": "For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share."}
{"prompt": "Of course not.", "completion": "Are you apprehensive?"}
{"prompt": "But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?", "completion": "It's artificial?"}
{"prompt": "It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.", "completion": "A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem."}
{"prompt": "Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.", "completion": "I'll see you in a minute."}

{"prompt": "The machine works.  She is.", "completion": "How many questions did it take?"}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "If she is, the machine works."}
{"prompt": "One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?", "completion": "Sitting next to you."}
{"prompt": "Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.", "completion": "Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "But in your profession that is a risk."}

{"prompt": "We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.", "completion": "How do you know I'm not?"}
{"prompt": "Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?", "completion": "I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?"}

{"prompt": "You like it?", "completion": "Bravo!"}
{"prompt": "I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.", "completion": "Oh, now, that's a great one!"}
{"prompt": "Hi!", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!", "completion": "Young man, stop right there!"}
{"prompt": "Let's go talk first, Adam.", "completion": "Yes, ma'am."}
{"prompt": "Well, that depends...", "completion": "I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "My office.", "completion": "For how long?"}
{"prompt": "We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.", "completion": "Come where?"}
{"prompt": "Fallout shelter. There's a difference.", "completion": "Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown."}
{"prompt": "How do you do?", "completion": "Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life."}
{"prompt": "Eve? I'm leaving.", "completion": "I'm Nina Aron, Adam."}
{"prompt": "Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.", "completion": "It certainly is.  I agree with you completely."}
{"prompt": "Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.", "completion": "Do ya?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?", "completion": "Shallow? I'm shallow?!"}
{"prompt": "Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "Please excuse this interruption.", "completion": "Oh, brother..."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--", "completion": "How 'bout a drink at the bar?"}
{"prompt": "I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?", "completion": "But I do miss that green sport coat of yours."}
{"prompt": "My mother's like that.", "completion": "How do you do?"}
{"prompt": "See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?", "completion": "We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!"}
{"prompt": "Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "...All right, Eve.  If you say so.", "completion": "...I do."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....", "completion": "Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise."}
{"prompt": "Neat. Goodnight!", "completion": "Hi, Eve!"}
{"prompt": "Really?  Okay!", "completion": "And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!"}
{"prompt": "My pleasure.", "completion": "It was at least as good as the sky."}
{"prompt": "That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?", "completion": "Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first."}
{"prompt": "I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.", "completion": "Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh. Adam?", "completion": "Yes, Eve?"}
{"prompt": "Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Sing it to me.", "completion": "\"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live.\"  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves."}
{"prompt": "Is that what you call it?", "completion": "But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called \"On the Street Where You Live.\"  You know it?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable."}
{"prompt": "Well, you had better!!", "completion": "There."}
{"prompt": "Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!", "completion": "I know first aid!"}
{"prompt": "Goodnight!", "completion": "Eve, if you'll let me, I can --"}
{"prompt": "Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!", "completion": "I know...and I'm really sorry."}
{"prompt": "Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!", "completion": "I'm really sorry!"}
{"prompt": "And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!", "completion": "Eve?!"}
{"prompt": "I'm leaving, too.", "completion": "But, Eve, I would--"}
{"prompt": "I don't blame you!", "completion": "Eve, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Adam?!", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!", "completion": "All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--"}
{"prompt": "You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!", "completion": "No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--"}
{"prompt": "Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.", "completion": "I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied."}
{"prompt": "You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!", "completion": "Why are you suddenly so mad at me?"}
{"prompt": "Did you?", "completion": "You wanted to see me!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end."}
{"prompt": "Okay. All right.  And what do I say?", "completion": "Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be."}
{"prompt": "Maybe. But that's how it works.", "completion": "Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me."}
{"prompt": "Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off \"you can't have me\" signals!", "completion": "That's ridiculous."}
{"prompt": "What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. I like that.", "completion": "Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it."}
{"prompt": "Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!", "completion": "How 'bout this one?"}
{"prompt": "Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what \"bitch\" means, don't you?", "completion": "Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you."}
{"prompt": "No way.", "completion": "Why?!  I think she's very attractive."}
{"prompt": "It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.", "completion": "What about her?"}
{"prompt": "And don't be so obvious!", "completion": "What have you ordered?"}
{"prompt": "Not that one!", "completion": "I like her."}
{"prompt": "Good-bye!", "completion": "I thought I was here to meet women."}
{"prompt": "Yes!", "completion": "Quit showing off!  We're here on business!"}
{"prompt": "No!  Not crazy!", "completion": "Do I look crazy?"}
{"prompt": "My goodness gracious!  This place is something!", "completion": "Look unimpressed."}
{"prompt": "Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.", "completion": "Well...yeah. Okay."}
{"prompt": "Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!", "completion": "Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--"}
{"prompt": "No it's not!", "completion": "Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean..."}
{"prompt": "I certainly do!", "completion": "Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?"}
{"prompt": "Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.", "completion": "Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, Eve!", "completion": "Have you ever heard the saying, \"He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?\""}
{"prompt": "He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!", "completion": "Okay!"}
{"prompt": "What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?", "completion": "It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo."}
{"prompt": "That's boring!", "completion": "About clothing?"}
{"prompt": "Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?", "completion": "The guy with the underpants!"}
{"prompt": "So, what are you seeing?", "completion": "The what?"}
{"prompt": "Uh...yeah.", "completion": "All right."}
{"prompt": "No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.", "completion": "May I please be excused?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "In the house?"}
{"prompt": "He's gone to check your answers on his computer.", "completion": "He has a computer?"}
{"prompt": "Good for you.", "completion": "Where's he gone?"}
{"prompt": "Wow.", "completion": "Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way."}
{"prompt": "Yes!", "completion": "You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!"}
{"prompt": "Um-hum.", "completion": "I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!", "completion": "Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Thank-Q!", "completion": "I thought only hookers drank those things."}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "Here you go.  One champagne cocktail."}
{"prompt": "He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?", "completion": "Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants."}
{"prompt": "I like it.", "completion": "Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?"}
{"prompt": "Is this your house?", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "You said it would be easy!", "completion": "I was wrong!!"}
{"prompt": "I told you I've never driven before!", "completion": "Never drive again!"}
{"prompt": "Sorry!", "completion": "You almost got us killed!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, ma'am!", "completion": "Stop that ma'am crap!"}
{"prompt": "The engine is still running.", "completion": "Now, get out!!"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Get out!"}
{"prompt": "Could we talk about that a little later?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.", "completion": "That's what I was afraid of."}
{"prompt": "When do you need her by?", "completion": "Two weeks."}
{"prompt": "No dogs, huh? Okay.", "completion": "And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?", "completion": "One who's not a mutant."}
{"prompt": "Everybody's divorced.", "completion": "It didn't used to be that way."}
{"prompt": "Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.", "completion": "They're all divorced?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "I didn't know that."}
{"prompt": "The big one!", "completion": "It does?"}
{"prompt": "You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!", "completion": "Bites what?"}
{"prompt": "Why?!", "completion": "I don't want to be alone."}
{"prompt": "What for?", "completion": "Because I want to get married."}
{"prompt": "A wife?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.", "completion": "Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife."}
{"prompt": "No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?", "completion": "This is for me."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sure it will!", "completion": "Then forget it."}
{"prompt": "Name it.", "completion": "Well, this is going to sound a little crazy."}
{"prompt": "Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.", "completion": "There's something else I would like you to help me with."}
{"prompt": "Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh..."}
{"prompt": "No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.", "completion": "You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you."}
{"prompt": "It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.", "completion": "I guess we'll need another locker."}
{"prompt": "Night!", "completion": "We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry."}
{"prompt": "Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.", "completion": "Hey, you know. I was thinking..."}
{"prompt": "Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Wait! Wait!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Very funny, smart ass.", "completion": "Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!"}
{"prompt": "Who are these people?", "completion": "My Mom and Dad."}
{"prompt": "Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?", "completion": "They like Dr. Pepper."}
{"prompt": "You got it! Wait here while I change.", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "What's fair?", "completion": "I've got to make at least a thousand a week."}
{"prompt": "Two weeks.", "completion": "What's the pay?"}
{"prompt": "Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.", "completion": "How long would you need me?"}
{"prompt": "Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.", "completion": "Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?"}
{"prompt": "Why not go to work for me?", "completion": "Doing what?"}
{"prompt": "...Okay.", "completion": "It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is."}
{"prompt": "Why does it never work out?  You and...men?", "completion": "Why?!  Who the hell knows?!"}
{"prompt": "Why doesn't it never work out?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Cross my heart and hope to die.", "completion": "See, ya."}
{"prompt": "Watching television in color.", "completion": "Hey, no kidding?  In color?"}
{"prompt": "I think it's the eyes.", "completion": "The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?"}
{"prompt": "Thank-Q!", "completion": "Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above."}
{"prompt": "Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Can't you please just talk to me for one second?", "completion": "Okay!  Damn!"}
{"prompt": "Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!", "completion": "I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!"}
{"prompt": "Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.", "completion": "Wait, Eve, please!  Wait."}
{"prompt": "Why are you doing that?", "completion": "I haven't brushed yet."}
{"prompt": "Take it. damn it!", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.", "completion": "I can't, it's yours."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!"}
{"prompt": "That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.", "completion": "Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase."}
{"prompt": "Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!", "completion": "I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, what are you doing?!", "completion": "I know a short-cut."}
{"prompt": "Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!", "completion": "You are one scary son-of-a-gun."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I could die...", "completion": "Over this?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay!  Take it easy!", "completion": "How's that?"}
{"prompt": "Perry?", "completion": "Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!"}
{"prompt": "What is it?!", "completion": "It's Perry!"}
{"prompt": "Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.", "completion": "Wait!  Wait!"}
{"prompt": "So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?", "completion": "It's Webber.  Adam Webber."}
{"prompt": "Heck, no!  What?!", "completion": "Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "And that's it?"}
{"prompt": "So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.", "completion": "So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?"}
{"prompt": "He's all yours. I was holding him back.", "completion": "Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!"}
{"prompt": "Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!", "completion": "Rogers Hornsby?!?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!", "completion": "Get away from me!!"}
{"prompt": "Nope.", "completion": "Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!"}
{"prompt": "If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.", "completion": "You don't?"}
{"prompt": "Do you own a car?", "completion": "I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car."}
{"prompt": "It was amazing.", "completion": "Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on."}
{"prompt": "Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!", "completion": "See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!"}
{"prompt": "Again.", "completion": "Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?"}
{"prompt": "So far?", "completion": "Yes, I'm right?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, that's nice.", "completion": "Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Why doesn't it?", "completion": "Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing."}
{"prompt": "I came on a bus.", "completion": "Why doesn't that surprise me?"}
{"prompt": "I just had a mental picture of...", "completion": "Here, pick these up!"}
{"prompt": "A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.", "completion": "What's wrong with you?"}
{"prompt": "Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.", "completion": "Dickhead?"}
{"prompt": "You're lost?", "completion": "Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?"}
{"prompt": "We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.", "completion": "No, I'm lost."}
{"prompt": "Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.", "completion": "Where are we going?"}
{"prompt": "No, you get out of here.", "completion": "Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner."}
{"prompt": "Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.", "completion": "Get out of here!"}
{"prompt": "Are you French?", "completion": "No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business."}
{"prompt": "Of course!", "completion": "Bon soir, mademoiselle!"}
{"prompt": "A card?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.", "completion": "Fill this out please. And I'll need a card."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Gee-ma-nee!", "completion": "Is this because of the radiation?"}
{"prompt": "Is that a birthday cake?!", "completion": "Yes, it is."}

{"prompt": "The front door is open.  Will you be back?", "completion": "I promise."}
{"prompt": "No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.", "completion": "How do I leave here?"}
{"prompt": "Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.", "completion": "That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I've got to go, now."}
{"prompt": "Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!", "completion": "I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?"}
{"prompt": "Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!", "completion": "All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!"}
{"prompt": "Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!", "completion": "Are you all right?"}
{"prompt": "My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  \"No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!\"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!", "completion": "Uh, I think they have."}
{"prompt": "Yes. That's kind of how it was.", "completion": "Uh-huh."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir. It's true.", "completion": "What? Did the politburo just one day say - \"We give up?\""}
{"prompt": "Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.", "completion": "That's what everybody believes?"}
{"prompt": "Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.", "completion": "You're sure?"}
{"prompt": "It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.", "completion": "Uh-huh."}
{"prompt": "Well, in that case...of course, son.", "completion": "This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?"}
{"prompt": "But, I don't understand.", "completion": "And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why."}
{"prompt": "One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.", "completion": "I'll try."}
{"prompt": "Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.", "completion": "I promise. Is that all?"}
{"prompt": "Also...stay out of the \"Adult Bookstore.\"", "completion": "Adult Bookstore.  Why?"}
{"prompt": "...the pipe tobacco.", "completion": "Yes, sir.  Is that all?"}

{"prompt": "C'est bon, Monsieur.", "completion": "Merci!"}
{"prompt": "Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.", "completion": "Shit is a French word?"}
{"prompt": "Well, do we just go on up?!", "completion": "No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious."}

{"prompt": "No kidding!", "completion": "Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, boy! A jacket!", "completion": "Your mom made that all by herself."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!", "completion": "Blow out the candles!"}
{"prompt": "Then why go there?", "completion": "Because he must!"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!"}
{"prompt": "No. Sit down.", "completion": "No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!"}
{"prompt": "Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.", "completion": "The nocturnal flying mammal?"}
{"prompt": "No, son. A pitcher.", "completion": "Like one of Mom's?"}
{"prompt": "It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.", "completion": "Like a painting?"}
{"prompt": "It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.", "completion": "What's baseball?"}
{"prompt": "You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.", "completion": "These are wonderful."}

{"prompt": "Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.", "completion": "Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday."}
{"prompt": "This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an \"investment.\"  These are stock \"certificates\" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.", "completion": "They're pretty.  Can I have them?"}
{"prompt": "And thanks for always being happy!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Bye, Troy!", "completion": "Bye, Adam!"}
{"prompt": "Good-bye, Adam.", "completion": "Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Does that work?", "completion": "Yeah...Seems to."}
{"prompt": "No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.", "completion": "I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore."}
{"prompt": "You bet!", "completion": "So, did you buy a movie?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!", "completion": "How 'bout we check with Eve first?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.", "completion": "No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.", "completion": "Okay. Thank you, my friends."}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "Ladies first, Troy! That was close."}
{"prompt": "Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.", "completion": "Oh. I see."}

{"prompt": "Amazing. I'm very impressed.", "completion": "That's why little things mean so much to him."}
{"prompt": "The recovery is very impressive.", "completion": "The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months."}
{"prompt": "I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.", "completion": "Almost all of them."}
{"prompt": "Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I just don't want to.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "I'm not wearing his pants.", "completion": "Why not? He has great pants."}
{"prompt": "True.", "completion": "Not on him."}
{"prompt": "Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?", "completion": "...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste."}
{"prompt": "He's a Windows guy then, huh?", "completion": "Yes. He likes windows."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him."}
{"prompt": "Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!", "completion": "That would knock my father out."}
{"prompt": "How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?", "completion": "Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America."}
{"prompt": "You don't have a computer in your cabin?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?", "completion": "I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It's so small."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, that's the largest city.", "completion": "This must be very new."}
{"prompt": "Juneau.", "completion": "Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!"}
{"prompt": "1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.", "completion": "What's the capitol?"}
{"prompt": "Russia.", "completion": "When did we get it from them?"}
{"prompt": "1959.", "completion": "Who use to own it?"}
{"prompt": "Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?", "completion": "Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?"}
{"prompt": "She's right?!", "completion": "I've got goose-bumps all over me."}
{"prompt": "That's right?", "completion": "I've never met anyone like you in my life."}
{"prompt": "Right on the button.", "completion": "Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town."}
{"prompt": "Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.", "completion": "Really?  Since when?"}
{"prompt": "It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.", "completion": "And it's called...?"}
{"prompt": "I love Lucy!", "completion": "You nut!"}
{"prompt": "Not particularly.", "completion": "Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or \"nori\" if you prefer. I love sushi."}
{"prompt": "You have very nice ceilings.", "completion": "I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.", "completion": "Goodnight."}
{"prompt": "I guess living up here makes people look older.", "completion": "Up here on the fifteenth floor?"}

{"prompt": "Thirty-five.", "completion": "You don't look thirty-five."}

{"prompt": "My father is a genius.", "completion": "No kiddin'. Well...good night."}

{"prompt": "Of what?", "completion": "The hotel."}
{"prompt": "Just look!!", "completion": "You dial nine to get out."}
{"prompt": "Up there!!", "completion": "I don't see anything!"}
{"prompt": "The sky!!!", "completion": "The sky?  Where?"}
{"prompt": "Gladly.", "completion": "What?  What is it?!"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?"}
{"prompt": "Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!", "completion": "You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home."}
{"prompt": "Come on. Frozen. How much are they?", "completion": "Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box."}
{"prompt": "Help you?", "completion": "Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties."}
{"prompt": "I do alright.", "completion": "Good!"}
{"prompt": "Say what?!", "completion": "How do you do, ma'am."}
{"prompt": "Whatcha looking at?", "completion": "Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!"}
{"prompt": "I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.", "completion": "Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?"}
{"prompt": "Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.", "completion": "Oh, you got a problem with that?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, that would be wonderful!", "completion": "Well, we're here to help!"}
{"prompt": "See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.", "completion": "I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box."}
{"prompt": "I was thinking of selling all the cards.", "completion": "Really? No kidding?"}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.", "completion": "Well, where are you --"}
{"prompt": "No, wait! At least stay for dinner!", "completion": "This is your bedroom?"}
{"prompt": "I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.", "completion": "We have to go."}
{"prompt": "Mom?  Eve and I have to go.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.", "completion": "A psychiatrist?!"}
{"prompt": "...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.", "completion": "Are you in trouble, son?!"}
{"prompt": "Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.", "completion": "Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents."}
{"prompt": "Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.", "completion": "Yes, ma'am."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.", "completion": "Yes, ma'am."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so."}
{"prompt": "I just hope this is still good up there.", "completion": "Mom?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, ma'am.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "You're my brave boy.", "completion": "I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid you've got to.", "completion": "I'll be all right."}
{"prompt": "He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.", "completion": "I'll go up."}
{"prompt": "Dad!", "completion": "Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, Mom!", "completion": "You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president."}
{"prompt": "Yes, ma'am.", "completion": "Elbows, Son."}
{"prompt": "Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.", "completion": "Oh. A nice one, I hope."}
{"prompt": "And now you must let me be the judge of that!", "completion": "I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is..."}
{"prompt": "Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.", "completion": "You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone."}
{"prompt": "I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--", "completion": "No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--"}
{"prompt": "He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.", "completion": "No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Oh, my God!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Good god."}
{"prompt": "The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.", "completion": "He drank it hot?"}
{"prompt": "What about relatives?", "completion": "All back East."}
{"prompt": "Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.", "completion": "Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess."}
{"prompt": "No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...", "completion": "According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  \"Boy?\"  Did you say you were a \"country boy?\"", "completion": "Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?", "completion": "\"Hell up here?\"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."}
{"prompt": "So...you...survived the blast, did you?", "completion": "The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: \"A country boy can survive!\""}
{"prompt": "What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "What can I offer you, Eve?", "completion": "You got a light, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...", "completion": "Some time."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...", "completion": "To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about."}
{"prompt": "How long will you set it for this time?", "completion": "I thought ten years."}
{"prompt": "And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.", "completion": "Amen."}
{"prompt": "He's smart.", "completion": "Yes, dear, I know."}
{"prompt": "And the ocean!  A mountain range!", "completion": "--do as I say!"}
{"prompt": "I want him to at least see the sky!", "completion": "--and we will--"}
{"prompt": "No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!", "completion": "Well, I am the head of this household--"}
{"prompt": "For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!", "completion": "We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Excuse me."}
{"prompt": "We stay down here.", "completion": "We do?"}
{"prompt": "They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.", "completion": "Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I don't believe it!"}
{"prompt": "Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Mutants?!", "completion": "It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! That's right!", "completion": "I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants."}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes it is!", "completion": "It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...\"good\"."}
{"prompt": "Should we say a little prayer first?", "completion": "Just open the door."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.", "completion": "I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "In the generator room again?"}
{"prompt": "You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?", "completion": "Would you excuse me?"}

{"prompt": "Let's eat our cake.", "completion": "Yeah. Let's dig in!"}
{"prompt": "Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!", "completion": "Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful."}
{"prompt": "Well, we did in my family!", "completion": "One who doesn't glow in the dark."}
{"prompt": "If he tells, it won't come true!", "completion": "Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!"}
{"prompt": "And I made these!", "completion": "What did you wish for, Adam?"}
{"prompt": "You bet.", "completion": "No kidding.  Who else would have done it?"}
{"prompt": "Coming!", "completion": "Get the presents and do the lights."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "Calvin!"}
{"prompt": "I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.", "completion": "Hi, honey!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.", "completion": "Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept."}
{"prompt": "Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.", "completion": "Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!"}
{"prompt": "Yes.  Well... yes.", "completion": "Watch this!"}
{"prompt": "No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!", "completion": "Very nice. Unless it caved in, too."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Right here!", "completion": "We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?"}

{"prompt": "I've noticed.", "completion": "What shall we call him?"}
{"prompt": "Is there a problem?", "completion": "No, Calvin.  Babies cry."}
{"prompt": "Uh, oh. Now it's time.", "completion": "Honey?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, no.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You have tranquilizers?", "completion": "I told you! I've got everything!"}
{"prompt": "No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!", "completion": "Would you like a tranquilizer?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe I've just got the creeps.", "completion": "How could you?! This is just like home!"}
{"prompt": "No, Calvin, you're favorite.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not hungry.", "completion": "Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!"}
{"prompt": "All our friends...", "completion": "Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child."}
{"prompt": "To go up.", "completion": "Hi, honey! Feeling better?"}
{"prompt": "It's safe.", "completion": "To go up."}
{"prompt": "Thirty -five years!", "completion": "Then after that it's safe."}
{"prompt": "The locks?", "completion": "To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years."}
{"prompt": "What's that noise?", "completion": "The locks."}
{"prompt": "Home sweet home!", "completion": "To you maybe."}
{"prompt": "Yes, dear!", "completion": "As long as we've got that straight."}
{"prompt": "I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.", "completion": "Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers."}
{"prompt": "Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!", "completion": "But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.", "completion": "Days??"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.", "completion": "How long will we have to stay down here?"}
{"prompt": "Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?", "completion": "Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?"}
{"prompt": "I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.", "completion": "Cheese is particularly troublesome."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates."}
{"prompt": "I never know anymore.", "completion": "You hear that?!"}
{"prompt": "Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.", "completion": "No.  They all do."}
{"prompt": "Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--", "completion": "It shuts off automatically."}
{"prompt": "We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?", "completion": "It's time."}
{"prompt": "You bet, hon!", "completion": "I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.", "completion": "Well, put it down and come in!"}
{"prompt": "I guess we shouldn't fight in here.", "completion": "For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Before I kick your ass.", "completion": "Stop it, you two!"}
{"prompt": "You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.", "completion": "Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel."}
{"prompt": "Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!", "completion": "So where is your roommate, the model?"}
{"prompt": "This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.", "completion": "Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be."}
{"prompt": "You came back for these?", "completion": "Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?"}
{"prompt": "I forgot some of my stuff.", "completion": "Your stuff?  Let me see that."}
{"prompt": "What are you bitching about now?", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Where?!", "completion": "Stop!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.", "completion": "Adam!!"}
{"prompt": "None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.", "completion": "Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home."}
{"prompt": "Come on.", "completion": "Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?"}
{"prompt": "You didn't stop anywhere else?!", "completion": "No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store."}
{"prompt": "Then what?", "completion": "We came back to the house!"}
{"prompt": "Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!", "completion": "To get some frozen poultry."}
{"prompt": "He was always so \"nice\"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! \"Nice\" is weird! Nice is...what is \"nice\"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?", "completion": "I don't know. I like to think so."}
{"prompt": "Have him committed.", "completion": "Yeah! That's thinking."}
{"prompt": "See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.", "completion": "Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!"}
{"prompt": "What's wrong?", "completion": "I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!"}
{"prompt": "And if we can't find him?", "completion": "We'll find him."}
{"prompt": "What do you want to do with it?", "completion": "Give it back to him."}
{"prompt": "Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?", "completion": "Fallout shelter."}
{"prompt": "Gay.", "completion": "Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, no!", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!", "completion": "I know...I know. You did the right thing."}
{"prompt": "I don't think so.", "completion": "Coward!"}
{"prompt": "What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?", "completion": "You're goddamn right I am!"}
{"prompt": "It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.", "completion": "Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!"}
{"prompt": "He left with Sophie.", "completion": "What?!!"}
{"prompt": "He didn't leave with them.", "completion": "Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that."}
{"prompt": "From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.", "completion": "So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible."}
{"prompt": "Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...", "completion": "Where did he get all that information?"}
{"prompt": "He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!", "completion": "Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is."}
{"prompt": "You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, you do!", "completion": "Or have perfect table manners."}
{"prompt": "Uh, yes, you do.", "completion": "Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, you do.", "completion": "And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!"}
{"prompt": "What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!", "completion": "In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days."}
{"prompt": "To bed?", "completion": "Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy."}
{"prompt": "Where are you going?", "completion": "To bed."}
{"prompt": "Those sluts!", "completion": "Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?"}
{"prompt": "I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?", "completion": "Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me."}
{"prompt": "Who did he leave with?", "completion": "What's it to you?!"}
{"prompt": "What's that mean?", "completion": "We did not leave together."}
{"prompt": "He go back to the hotel?", "completion": "Uh..he might of."}
{"prompt": "Go to the bathroom.", "completion": "Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!"}
{"prompt": "Um... Eve?", "completion": "It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.", "completion": "Adam,  I think for you, we should go for \"sweet.\""}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!", "completion": "Eve?!"}
{"prompt": "Always good advice.", "completion": "For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us."}
{"prompt": "He's from Alaska.", "completion": "Just be yourself."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "That water's freezing!"}
{"prompt": "Let me show you the entire trousseau!", "completion": "How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?"}
{"prompt": "Well, what do you think?", "completion": "I think...it...works."}
{"prompt": "I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.", "completion": "What do you think, Adam?"}
{"prompt": "That's what I'm sensing.", "completion": "Alright, I will."}
{"prompt": "I see \"elegant.\"", "completion": "Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.", "completion": "And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.", "completion": "Well, that's blunt!"}
{"prompt": "You're serious, aren't you?", "completion": "What's that supposed to mean?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo."}
{"prompt": "But first, you have to start with the clothes!", "completion": "Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that."}
{"prompt": "Give me your hand.", "completion": "Oh, my God..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes.", "completion": "I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?"}
{"prompt": "Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.", "completion": "Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs."}
{"prompt": "Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.", "completion": "So, Adam...where on earth are you from?"}
{"prompt": "Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!", "completion": "I knew you'd like him."}
{"prompt": "Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!", "completion": "I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway."}
{"prompt": "Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...", "completion": "Buy it from me?"}
{"prompt": "Um...uh...", "completion": "I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!"}
{"prompt": "Uh...yeah. It's like hard.", "completion": "I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?"}
{"prompt": "You bet, Mom! Coming up!", "completion": "I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!"}
{"prompt": "Roger, Wolf One.", "completion": "I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!"}
{"prompt": "The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.", "completion": "I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting."}
{"prompt": "Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?", "completion": "Tower, say again!!"}
{"prompt": "Wolf One -- say intentions.", "completion": "I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject."}
{"prompt": "Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?", "completion": "Stand by. One."}
{"prompt": "Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.", "completion": "Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.", "completion": "Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by."}
{"prompt": "Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.", "completion": "Okay honey."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah? Have you seen any?", "completion": "I've seen a few."}
{"prompt": "Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?", "completion": "Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house."}
{"prompt": "Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?", "completion": "I'm not sick."}
{"prompt": "Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?", "completion": "No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry."}
{"prompt": "I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.", "completion": "Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed."}
{"prompt": "You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?", "completion": "Yeah. How's Dad?"}
{"prompt": "Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.", "completion": "I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have."}
{"prompt": "EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.", "completion": "See you Tuesday, Frank."}
{"prompt": "If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.", "completion": "Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone."}
{"prompt": "To your health, Frank.", "completion": "Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank."}
{"prompt": "Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.", "completion": "Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are."}
{"prompt": "Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?", "completion": "Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?"}
{"prompt": "Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?", "completion": "Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.", "completion": "Fine. Welcome. Come sit down."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God. Is her son OK?", "completion": "Frank. Come in."}
{"prompt": "Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?", "completion": "Not yet."}
{"prompt": "We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.", "completion": "Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place."}
{"prompt": "Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?", "completion": "Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom."}
{"prompt": "Yes sir.", "completion": "Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!"}
{"prompt": "Yes sir. I sure am.", "completion": "For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later."}
{"prompt": "Only you and the photo lab.", "completion": "You're all through with this now?"}
{"prompt": "No, not at all.", "completion": "Who knows you have these?"}
{"prompt": "I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.", "completion": "Is Sandy part of this?"}
{"prompt": "I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.", "completion": "Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.", "completion": "And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Okay?"}
{"prompt": "Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.", "completion": "Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift."}
{"prompt": "It's blue. Blue velvet.", "completion": "Jeffrey! Come on in."}
{"prompt": "Blue. It's Blue Velvet.", "completion": "What color is it?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I get it.", "completion": "What is this? What color is it?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you do it?", "completion": "I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance."}
{"prompt": "I guess you've seen some bad things.", "completion": "Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you."}
{"prompt": "Is that why you say it's horrible?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Anything you can tell me?", "completion": "The criminals are winning."}
{"prompt": "These are beautiful. How's the case coming?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures."}
{"prompt": "And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.", "completion": "Jeffrey?"}
{"prompt": "I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.", "completion": "It must be great."}
{"prompt": "Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.", "completion": "I understand. I'm just real curious like you said."}
{"prompt": "Come into the study a minute.", "completion": "Excuse me, Mrs. Williams."}
{"prompt": "Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.", "completion": "Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way."}
{"prompt": "Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.", "completion": "By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?"}
{"prompt": "You did? A human ear?", "completion": "Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you."}
{"prompt": "Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?", "completion": "He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?"}
{"prompt": "Hold me. I'M FALLING!", "completion": "Are you Detective Williams?"}
{"prompt": "HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!", "completion": "I promise, Dorothy. I promise."}
{"prompt": "Hold me, Don.", "completion": "Don? Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "Who, Dorothy?", "completion": "Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!"}
{"prompt": "My secret lover.", "completion": "They hurt his head."}
{"prompt": "Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.", "completion": "It's okay. It's okay."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's me.", "completion": "Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God."}
{"prompt": "Oh no.", "completion": "No.  Hi baby."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.", "completion": "You look beautiful to me."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I think I better go.", "completion": "I'll call you."}
{"prompt": "I guess I should go.", "completion": "I want you to stay with me."}
{"prompt": "Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.", "completion": "No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright."}
{"prompt": "I did. Are you?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.", "completion": "You called me Jeffrey."}
{"prompt": "There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.", "completion": "Dorothy. No!"}
{"prompt": "Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?", "completion": "I'm glad you do."}
{"prompt": "You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.", "completion": "There's no disease, I can tell you."}
{"prompt": "Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.", "completion": "You what?"}
{"prompt": "No, it's not Don.", "completion": "I didn't mean to hurt you."}
{"prompt": "Just get outta my bed.", "completion": "I love you Don with all my heart."}
{"prompt": "And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!", "completion": "Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!"}
{"prompt": "I asked first.", "completion": "Sometimes I think I do."}
{"prompt": "Do you love me?", "completion": "Do you love me?"}
{"prompt": "Look, snap out of it, will ya?", "completion": "Kiss me."}
{"prompt": "Come on Dorothy.", "completion": "What if Frank came over here and found us?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Beeeee careful."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.", "completion": "Does that scare you?"}
{"prompt": "That wouldn't be too good, would it?", "completion": "Frank would open you."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "What if I told Frank that you opened me?"}
{"prompt": "No police!!!  No police!!", "completion": "You like to open me, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "I want you to hurt me.", "completion": "No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.", "completion": "What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Are you a bad boy?", "completion": "Whatiya mean?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want to do?", "completion": "I'm doing it."}

{"prompt": "I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.", "completion": "That's good."}
{"prompt": "No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.", "completion": "I sure don't hate you."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Frank--", "completion": "Frank is coming?"}
{"prompt": "It used to make me laugh, but.", "completion": "I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy."}
{"prompt": "Come in.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "No. I should go.", "completion": "Please, please stay."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now."}
{"prompt": "I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?", "completion": "Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?"}
{"prompt": "No. But you're in very big trouble.", "completion": "Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?"}
{"prompt": "Who is Don?", "completion": "Don? Are you in with them?"}
{"prompt": "Falling.", "completion": "No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?"}
{"prompt": "Look.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.", "completion": "Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?"}
{"prompt": "Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.", "completion": "There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it."}
{"prompt": "Nice guy. Who's he?", "completion": "Who's it, you mean."}
{"prompt": "Frank? Can you stand up?", "completion": "I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet."}
{"prompt": "Same here.", "completion": "Oh shit."}
{"prompt": "That's not crazy. I like you too.", "completion": "I liked being with you last night."}

{"prompt": "Don't say that.", "completion": "It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now."}
{"prompt": "Then don't talk about killing.", "completion": "Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die."}
{"prompt": "Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.", "completion": "Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you."}
{"prompt": "No. What is happening?", "completion": "Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "You don't?"}
{"prompt": "Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?", "completion": "Do you know?"}
{"prompt": "I made it go down the toilet.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I like you.", "completion": "You can be my special friend and come and put that in me."}
{"prompt": "No, please. I won't.", "completion": "Do you like me?"}
{"prompt": "You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.", "completion": "You can hit me, if you want to."}
{"prompt": "See my nipples?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "See my breasts? See?", "completion": "Yes."}

{"prompt": "Lie down on the bed.", "completion": "Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Do you like talk like that?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Do you like that?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I, I don't know.", "completion": "What do you want?"}

{"prompt": "NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.", "completion": "Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave."}
{"prompt": "How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.", "completion": "No. Come on."}
{"prompt": "How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?", "completion": "Never before this."}
{"prompt": "THEN WHAT?", "completion": "Then you got undressed."}
{"prompt": "That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?", "completion": "Well."}
{"prompt": "The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.", "completion": "You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more."}

{"prompt": "Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.", "completion": "Yes? What is it?"}
{"prompt": "He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.", "completion": "No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.", "completion": "Oh he forced you, huh?"}
{"prompt": "He's comin' back? What for?", "completion": "'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight."}
{"prompt": "Bull.", "completion": "Alright, suit yourself."}
{"prompt": "Frank gone?", "completion": "Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back."}
{"prompt": "Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.", "completion": "Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty."}
{"prompt": "Can I feel 'em?", "completion": "If you want to."}
{"prompt": "Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?", "completion": "Those are my breasts."}
{"prompt": "Look at these. What are these?", "completion": "Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but.", "completion": "Then, shut up!"}
{"prompt": "Frank?", "completion": "You want to see him too, right?"}
{"prompt": "Where are we going, Frank?", "completion": "Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too."}
{"prompt": "He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.", "completion": "From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?"}
{"prompt": "Baby wants to fuck.", "completion": "Who's this fuck?"}
{"prompt": "MOMMY!", "completion": "Mommy's here."}
{"prompt": "Hello, daddy.", "completion": "My bourbon."}
{"prompt": "Hello, baby.", "completion": "Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head."}
{"prompt": "We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.", "completion": "Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?"}
{"prompt": "You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.", "completion": "Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?"}
{"prompt": "We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?", "completion": "He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!"}
{"prompt": "Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?", "completion": "Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?"}
{"prompt": "What are you lookin' at?", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back."}
{"prompt": "Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.", "completion": "Hey? You like to walk."}
{"prompt": "Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.", "completion": "Here's to Ben."}
{"prompt": "Heineken.", "completion": "FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!"}
{"prompt": "On a ride.", "completion": "A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to go.", "completion": "Go where?"}
{"prompt": "No thanks.", "completion": "No thanks. What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "Hello?", "completion": "Speak to me Fucker."}
{"prompt": "There ya go.", "completion": "Good, let's drink up."}
{"prompt": "Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?", "completion": "No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer."}
{"prompt": "What kinda beer do you like?", "completion": "Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?"}
{"prompt": "Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.", "completion": "Okay Frank."}
{"prompt": "Nothing. I'm fine.", "completion": "You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late."}
{"prompt": "God, you scared me.", "completion": "Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?"}
{"prompt": "Can I use the car tonight?", "completion": "Of course, Jeffrey."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm just gonna walk around.", "completion": "Alright."}
{"prompt": "I'm going out for awhile.", "completion": "Do you want the car?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks a lot, Mom.", "completion": "Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you."}
{"prompt": "Well. Okay.", "completion": "Jeffrey, when you see your father."}
{"prompt": "What time are visiting hours?", "completion": "I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning."}
{"prompt": "Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.", "completion": "Be right down."}
{"prompt": "Where's all your things, Jeffrey?", "completion": "This is it."}
{"prompt": "Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.", "completion": "Mom."}
{"prompt": "I mean, for good, Jeffrey.", "completion": "For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term."}
{"prompt": "Sandy?... Sandy, please.", "completion": "I'll get a coat for her."}
{"prompt": "Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?", "completion": "Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon."}
{"prompt": "Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.", "completion": "Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes."}
{"prompt": "Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?", "completion": "That sounds great!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.", "completion": "Say \"goodnight\" to Sandy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. okay.", "completion": "He comes over to study."}
{"prompt": "No. No thank you.", "completion": "It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know.", "completion": "Would you like a piece of cake?"}
{"prompt": "Alright.", "completion": "I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame."}
{"prompt": "I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.", "completion": "Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?"}
{"prompt": "Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?", "completion": "Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!", "completion": "Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.", "completion": "Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?"}
{"prompt": "No, you're right.", "completion": "I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered."}
{"prompt": "Well.", "completion": "I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Looks like you'd make a good runner."}
{"prompt": "Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.", "completion": "Good deal Dad."}
{"prompt": "It's good to see you, Dad.", "completion": "How ya doin' Dad?"}
{"prompt": "Uh-uh.", "completion": "Good to see you, son."}
{"prompt": "Uh-uh.", "completion": "Are you feeling okay?"}
{"prompt": "Hey Jeff.", "completion": "Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.", "completion": "Hi Dad."}
{"prompt": "Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.", "completion": "Look Jeffrey."}
{"prompt": "Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.", "completion": "No Jeffrey!!"}
{"prompt": "Sandy?", "completion": "Go ahead!"}
{"prompt": "I should go with her, Sandy.", "completion": "Go ahead."}
{"prompt": "Jeffrey? What's going on?", "completion": "Shhh. I'll tell you."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.", "completion": "Right. Watch out for Mike, there."}
{"prompt": "No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?", "completion": "Probably not. No. Why?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?"}
{"prompt": "Dorothy!... Dorothy!", "completion": "Dorothy Vallens?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you."}
{"prompt": "Frank!!!", "completion": "My father has a gun at home."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Oh my God. What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Just a minute.", "completion": "You want to dance?"}
{"prompt": "NO.", "completion": "Let's wait for some slow one."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Really. You want to dance with someone else?"}
{"prompt": "You want to dance?", "completion": "I can't dance fast."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?", "completion": "I like that idea, that's a real good idea."}
{"prompt": "It's okay.", "completion": "You look beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?", "completion": "I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime."}
{"prompt": "It's good to see you.", "completion": "Where to?"}
{"prompt": "What was that all about?", "completion": "Nothing, really! It's good to see you."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "Just some fatherly advice."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Great!", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?", "completion": "You didn't tell him about me?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.", "completion": "Everything okay?"}
{"prompt": "Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.", "completion": "Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it."}
{"prompt": "You worry about me really?", "completion": "Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this."}
{"prompt": "You like mysteries that much?", "completion": "Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much."}
{"prompt": "Jeffrey? Why?", "completion": "I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Jeffrey!!", "completion": "Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah?", "completion": "Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken."}
{"prompt": "Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.", "completion": "Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him."}
{"prompt": "Shoot.", "completion": "Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?"}
{"prompt": "You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.", "completion": "That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?"}
{"prompt": "You want to go talk to him?", "completion": "Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later."}
{"prompt": "I'm really sorry.", "completion": "What am I going to do?"}
{"prompt": "See ya tomorrow.", "completion": "You were late."}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay.", "completion": "Goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Can I give you a kiss good night?", "completion": "You better not, Jeffrey."}
{"prompt": "Okay, be careful.", "completion": "Okay, Sandy."}
{"prompt": "No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.", "completion": "I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?"}
{"prompt": "So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.", "completion": "I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.", "completion": "Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl."}
{"prompt": "You're sure right. It is a strange world.", "completion": "Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?"}
{"prompt": "Who, me? Why should it?", "completion": "That's what I thought."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "That doesn't bother you, does it?"}
{"prompt": "Did you see her undressed?", "completion": "Yeah. I mean a little, you know."}
{"prompt": "Twice. Without her sensing anything?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "You saw a lot in one night.", "completion": "Actually. I've been in twice."}
{"prompt": "Wow. Should you tell my father?", "completion": "I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble."}
{"prompt": "You want to tell me about it?", "completion": "OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the \"yellow man\". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."}
{"prompt": "You want a Dairy Queen?", "completion": "No way. I'm about to blow up."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, I didn't...", "completion": "It's okay. Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "What's with Mike?", "completion": "He got a little jealous."}
{"prompt": "What did you see?", "completion": "Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?"}
{"prompt": "Well, how did it go? What happened?", "completion": "Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved."}
{"prompt": "That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?", "completion": "Okay, okay. Bye."}
{"prompt": "Okay, thanks.", "completion": "I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert."}
{"prompt": "Are you sure?", "completion": "I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I'm going to wait here until she comes."}
{"prompt": "Look, it can wait till Sunday.", "completion": "Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, okay, can I call?", "completion": "Okay, yeah, call."}
{"prompt": "I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.", "completion": "I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over."}
{"prompt": "Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.", "completion": "I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee."}
{"prompt": "Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?", "completion": "OK."}
{"prompt": "It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?", "completion": "Yeah, but."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you."}
{"prompt": "I'll drink to that.", "completion": "Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it."}
{"prompt": "Two.", "completion": "Here's to. An interesting experience."}
{"prompt": "This is not my usual Friday night!", "completion": "That sounds good."}
{"prompt": "Brilliant.", "completion": "Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there."}
{"prompt": "What's the plan.", "completion": "First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.", "completion": "Okay. You better get out before someone sees us."}
{"prompt": "I already know. The \"Slow Club\". It's on Route 7.", "completion": "Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?"}
{"prompt": "I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?", "completion": "First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings."}
{"prompt": "You really want to do this, don't you?", "completion": "I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder."}
{"prompt": "Yes. I do.", "completion": "Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that."}
{"prompt": "I owe you, since I goofed up this one.", "completion": "You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?"}
{"prompt": "So, what's next?", "completion": "Pretty clever. Are you game for more?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, if it opens the door.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.", "completion": "I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?"}
{"prompt": "I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?", "completion": "Yes and no. Did you recognize him?"}
{"prompt": "Are you alright?", "completion": "Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.", "completion": "Alright. Good luck, yourself."}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?", "completion": "Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy."}
{"prompt": "Alright.", "completion": "Let's go."}
{"prompt": "You've got a point there.", "completion": "Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.", "completion": "Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this."}
{"prompt": "What will I say when she comes to the door?", "completion": "You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few \"Awake\" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"}
{"prompt": "Now, how are you going to do that?", "completion": "Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window."}
{"prompt": "It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.", "completion": "Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later."}
{"prompt": "You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.", "completion": "Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?"}
{"prompt": "Alright, now tell me. What is it?", "completion": "There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe."}
{"prompt": "I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.", "completion": "Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to cause any trouble.", "completion": "I'm here, aren't I?"}
{"prompt": "I'd like to talk to you about something.", "completion": "Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute."}
{"prompt": "You hungry or thirsty, or both?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.", "completion": "Yeah. Good bye."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.", "completion": "I guess I'll see you sometime."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. He moved away.", "completion": "I've gotta go in."}
{"prompt": "It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.", "completion": "What happened to him?"}
{"prompt": "I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.", "completion": "Still, it must be kinda rough."}
{"prompt": "You really do hear a lot, don't you?", "completion": "Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?", "completion": "My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered."}
{"prompt": "Did they find out anything when they questioned her?", "completion": "I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case."}
{"prompt": "Where are they?", "completion": "I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you."}
{"prompt": "Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.", "completion": "That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.", "completion": "I guess you have to get back home soon?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe so.", "completion": "It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?"}
{"prompt": "No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.", "completion": "The ear is from a missing person maybe?"}
{"prompt": "There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.", "completion": "Were all these people questioned this afternoon?"}
{"prompt": "I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.", "completion": "Do you know who was brought in for questioning?"}
{"prompt": "Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?", "completion": "Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?"}
{"prompt": "That's too bad.", "completion": "What do you know about the ear? Anything?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. What are you doing now?", "completion": "I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital."}
{"prompt": "Terrible boring.", "completion": "What else is new? Right?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "How is Central these days?"}
{"prompt": "Am I bothering you?", "completion": "No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?"}
{"prompt": "You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?", "completion": "Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something."}
{"prompt": "I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.", "completion": "Oh yeah?"}
{"prompt": "You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?", "completion": "Yeah, how did you know?"}
{"prompt": "Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.", "completion": "Stop it Mike."}
{"prompt": "Come on out a minute, okay?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?", "completion": "Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me."}
{"prompt": "I don't know why we have to watch TV.", "completion": "Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on."}
{"prompt": "What are watchin' this junk for?", "completion": "You can change it if you want to."}
{"prompt": "Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.", "completion": "Yeah, nice meetin' you."}
{"prompt": "Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.", "completion": "Oh fuck!"}
{"prompt": "Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.", "completion": "Up where?"}
{"prompt": "Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.", "completion": "Just for him?"}
{"prompt": "Go find one.", "completion": "What did he bring him in for?"}
{"prompt": "Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.", "completion": "There's ways around that."}
{"prompt": "Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.", "completion": "Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something."}
{"prompt": "The Duke?  What did you do?", "completion": "This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it."}
{"prompt": "Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?", "completion": "I need Il Duce."}
{"prompt": "I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?", "completion": "Hey, I just..."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you.", "completion": "Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around."}
{"prompt": "Are ya ready?", "completion": "Aye."}
{"prompt": "Yes mother.", "completion": "I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!"}
{"prompt": "What did you do, Connor?", "completion": "Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'."}
{"prompt": "Lord's name.", "completion": "Mother Mary, full of grace."}
{"prompt": "The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?", "completion": "You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?"}
{"prompt": "Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Any tips on where these guys may be?", "completion": "Any word back from the E.R.s?"}
{"prompt": "Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.", "completion": "Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one."}
{"prompt": "Got it.", "completion": "Are these me considered armed and dangerous?"}
{"prompt": "I can't find the second one, sir.", "completion": "Look under the body."}
{"prompt": "Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.", "completion": "Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue."}
{"prompt": "You gotta keep going.", "completion": "Yes sir."}
{"prompt": "You guys?", "completion": "We're here brother."}
{"prompt": "Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.", "completion": "You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man."}
{"prompt": "You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.", "completion": "Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing."}
{"prompt": "They got nothing.", "completion": "This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will."}
{"prompt": "Shit.", "completion": "What?  What, that guy?"}
{"prompt": "Look again for fuck sake!", "completion": "I know what the fuck he looks like!"}
{"prompt": "Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!", "completion": "Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!"}
{"prompt": "Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.", "completion": "C'mon!"}
{"prompt": "Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.", "completion": "You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit."}
{"prompt": "Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.", "completion": "No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole."}
{"prompt": "What? What is it?", "completion": "This place is like a scumbag yard sale."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck are you doing?", "completion": "I-I'll tip her."}
{"prompt": "I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.", "completion": "MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well...", "completion": "Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?"}
{"prompt": "Anybody see ya?", "completion": "Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man."}
{"prompt": "What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.", "completion": "Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!"}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!"}
{"prompt": "No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.", "completion": "Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!"}
{"prompt": "No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.", "completion": "Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in."}
{"prompt": "No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?", "completion": "He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?"}
{"prompt": "You think they sold me out? No way.", "completion": "He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?"}
{"prompt": "What are you saying?", "completion": "Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?"}
{"prompt": "She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.", "completion": "Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night."}
{"prompt": "Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.", "completion": "You sound real remorseful."}
{"prompt": "Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.", "completion": "Donna's gonna be angry about her cat."}
{"prompt": "Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.", "completion": "Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?"}
{"prompt": "Get a hold of yourself, man.", "completion": "Anybody you think is evil?"}
{"prompt": "Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.", "completion": "What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!"}
{"prompt": "Let's do him right here.", "completion": "What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!"}
{"prompt": "This is a six-shooter.", "completion": "Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?"}
{"prompt": "Where's your gun?", "completion": "Chest pocket.  Shit!"}
{"prompt": "All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.", "completion": "Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!"}
{"prompt": "Still bickerin' over that, huh?", "completion": "Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, we promise.", "completion": "Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'."}
{"prompt": "What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!", "completion": "Well, I didn't but..."}
{"prompt": "Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.", "completion": "Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts."}
{"prompt": "BLAME...", "completion": "How's Uncle Sibeal?"}
{"prompt": "Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.", "completion": "No ma! No!"}
{"prompt": "What?! What are you doin'?", "completion": "I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger."}
{"prompt": "I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.", "completion": "What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?"}
{"prompt": "It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.", "completion": "Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here."}
{"prompt": "Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.", "completion": "Ma, what's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Connor, is that you?", "completion": "Mother, is that you?"}
{"prompt": "I'll call you tonight, afterwards.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.", "completion": "Be careful."}
{"prompt": "I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.", "completion": "I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.", "completion": "So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?"}
{"prompt": "Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.", "completion": "Our mother can see through bags."}
{"prompt": "We paid attention in school.", "completion": "Know any other languages?"}
{"prompt": "They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?", "completion": "So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?"}
{"prompt": "You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?", "completion": "We... met them last night."}
{"prompt": "me up the...", "completion": "Ass!"}
{"prompt": "Would someone please come over here and...", "completion": "Fuck!"}
{"prompt": "Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.", "completion": "y-y-yeah that's what he said."}
{"prompt": "An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.", "completion": "What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt": "And we will send you to whatever God you wish.", "completion": "We're alive."}
{"prompt": "There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.", "completion": "For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it."}
{"prompt": "Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.", "completion": "These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost."}
{"prompt": "With every breath we shall hunt them down.", "completion": "Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies."}
{"prompt": "It is your corrupt we claim.", "completion": "It is your evil, who will be sought by us."}
{"prompt": "We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.", "completion": "We do not want your tired and sick."}
{"prompt": "He's a good man.", "completion": "Now, you will receive us."}
{"prompt": "And he is one smart man.", "completion": "He isn't to be touched."}
{"prompt": "A-fuckin'-men!", "completion": "That's the guy that got us off the hook with the \"Checkov\" thing."}
{"prompt": "Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.", "completion": "There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?"}
{"prompt": "So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?", "completion": "Give the guy a shot."}
{"prompt": "I'm strangely comfortable with it.", "completion": "We've teamed up with a sex offender."}
{"prompt": "Holy shit. Who? How many?", "completion": "So what do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Then what the fuck?", "completion": "Who did you kill?"}
{"prompt": "Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.", "completion": "Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?", "completion": "Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day."}
{"prompt": "Yes, we are.", "completion": "Nine bodies."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.", "completion": "Oh, we're good man."}
{"prompt": "Aye.", "completion": "On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch."}
{"prompt": "Sh, sh! Fuck you!", "completion": "That was way easier than I thought."}
{"prompt": "We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.", "completion": "Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!"}
{"prompt": "We'll find it. Just calm down.", "completion": "No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds."}
{"prompt": "Just like on TV.", "completion": "Where the fuck are you going?"}
{"prompt": "Me, too.", "completion": "See. I told you there'd be a shaft."}
{"prompt": "Nervous?", "completion": "A bit."}
{"prompt": "Is that right, Rambo?", "completion": "All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope."}
{"prompt": "I don't know they just always need it.", "completion": "What is all this \"they\" shit? This ain't a movie."}
{"prompt": "I'm serious.", "completion": "Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.", "completion": "Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?"}
{"prompt": "Charlie Bronson's always got rope.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Know what we need, man?... some rope.", "completion": "For what?"}
{"prompt": "Destroy all that which is evil...", "completion": "...so that which is good may flourish"}
{"prompt": "Absolutely not.", "completion": "No pictures, either."}
{"prompt": "German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.", "completion": "Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good."}
{"prompt": "Italian.", "completion": "I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked."}
{"prompt": "\"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan.\"", "completion": "How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?", "completion": "\"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?\""}
{"prompt": "Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.", "completion": "Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. We're ready.", "completion": "A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush."}
{"prompt": "\"What do we tell him about the guns and money?\"", "completion": "\"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there.\""}
{"prompt": "All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?", "completion": "Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years."}
{"prompt": "He got beat up by a girl.", "completion": "If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes."}
{"prompt": "I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.", "completion": "Don't even do it, ya bastard."}
{"prompt": "Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.", "completion": "Oh, Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Shut it. It's Ma.", "completion": "Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!"}
{"prompt": "Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.", "completion": "No fuckin' hot water man. That..."}
{"prompt": "How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?", "completion": "How many?"}
{"prompt": "Hey Murphy?", "completion": "Aye."}
{"prompt": "I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.", "completion": "Aye."}
{"prompt": "Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?", "completion": "Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax."}
{"prompt": "I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!", "completion": "Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb."}
{"prompt": "Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...", "completion": "Rule of thumb?"}
{"prompt": "I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.", "completion": "Okay then... let's get ya started."}
{"prompt": "How do you figure?", "completion": "Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends."}
{"prompt": "That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.", "completion": "The shooter knew these guys, huh?"}
{"prompt": "No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.", "completion": "And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories."}
{"prompt": "Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.", "completion": "Maybe the three of them had something in common."}
{"prompt": "Three.", "completion": "Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?"}
{"prompt": "They were wearing masks.", "completion": "Of course they were. How many?"}
{"prompt": "She was in here when it went down.", "completion": "Can she I.D. them?"}
{"prompt": "So, what do we do now?", "completion": "That depends. You either do your job or get ethical."}
{"prompt": "Uh... two shooters!", "completion": "Fan-fuckin-tastic!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.", "completion": "And number three, Dolly."}
{"prompt": "Male or female, bitch?!!", "completion": "Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that."}
{"prompt": "Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!", "completion": "It was... It was..."}
{"prompt": "Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...", "completion": "Pee...Per...Man."}
{"prompt": "Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!", "completion": "My, my..."}
{"prompt": "I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!", "completion": "You killed my... my..."}
{"prompt": "I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!", "completion": "You... oh god, why?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Where's my cat?"}
{"prompt": "No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!", "completion": "Rocco!"}
{"prompt": "Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.", "completion": "Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet."}
{"prompt": "Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.", "completion": "Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident."}
{"prompt": "Why was I not informed of this?", "completion": "These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him."}
{"prompt": "Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?", "completion": "Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out."}
{"prompt": "Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.", "completion": "No way they could have seen it?"}
{"prompt": "It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.", "completion": "And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out."}
{"prompt": "Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.", "completion": "Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?"}
{"prompt": "Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!", "completion": "What about one guy with two guns?"}
{"prompt": "They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.", "completion": "Excellent! Number two. Greenly."}
{"prompt": "The Sicilians.", "completion": "The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.", "completion": "The Greeks. The Italians."}
{"prompt": "New hitman wants to leave his mark", "completion": "That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent."}
{"prompt": "He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.", "completion": "And the pennies?"}
{"prompt": "The fat man.", "completion": "Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?"}
{"prompt": "These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...", "completion": "The what man?"}
{"prompt": "Really want to know?", "completion": "So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?", "completion": "So what are you thinkin' here?"}
{"prompt": "Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!", "completion": "What if it was just one guy with six guns?"}
{"prompt": "Who were the victims?", "completion": "A couple of peons for the mob and..."}
{"prompt": "No way they could have seen it.", "completion": "They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur."}
{"prompt": "After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?", "completion": "Witness?"}
{"prompt": "Uh.  Shit, I, uh...", "completion": "It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!"}
{"prompt": "While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?", "completion": "Shit! Shit!"}
{"prompt": "How many bodies, Greenly?", "completion": "Eight."}
{"prompt": "Why do you always disrespect me like that?", "completion": "Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table."}
{"prompt": "Sweet-n-low!", "completion": "He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?"}
{"prompt": "Twist of lemon!", "completion": "Chief, what the fuck is this?"}
{"prompt": "Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?", "completion": "Who the..."}
{"prompt": "That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.", "completion": "Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?"}
{"prompt": "Promise me boys.", "completion": "We promise."}
{"prompt": "But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.", "completion": "Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does."}
{"prompt": "It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.", "completion": "Just called ta torture us did ya?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, she's quite proud of herself.", "completion": "Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now."}
{"prompt": "Oh my god!", "completion": "I..."}
{"prompt": "What the...?", "completion": "I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now."}
{"prompt": "We'll keep going, Roc.", "completion": "You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever."}
{"prompt": "Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.", "completion": "We have to go now.  We're on the lamb."}
{"prompt": "You bet your ass he will.", "completion": "Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck do you mean?", "completion": "I mean he ain't here."}
{"prompt": "Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!", "completion": "Shit!... Shit! He ain't here."}

{"prompt": "Has he now?", "completion": "You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day."}

{"prompt": "Yeah, I saw it.", "completion": "I'm lookout."}
{"prompt": "That's not what I meant, Dignan.", "completion": "Did you see that?"}

{"prompt": "Where are you going?", "completion": "I don't appreciate you ridiculing me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.", "completion": "Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?"}
{"prompt": "Every valuable item in the house was on that list.", "completion": "That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her."}

{"prompt": "She's really kind of hot.", "completion": "She's an attractive older woman."}

{"prompt": "Would they do that?", "completion": "Who knows? That's why I filed it down."}
{"prompt": "Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.", "completion": "That's true. But what if they change the locks?"}
{"prompt": "No. This is he.", "completion": "Did you see what I meant about the window?"}
{"prompt": "He says. This is he.", "completion": "This is he?"}
{"prompt": "The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.", "completion": "What does Starsky say?"}
{"prompt": "As part of his plan. I don't know why.", "completion": "See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream."}
{"prompt": "No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.", "completion": "I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony."}
{"prompt": "Dignan, it's --", "completion": "Plus where's Huggie Bear?"}
{"prompt": "Right. The blond guy.", "completion": "OK. That's wrong."}

{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It's an esoteric journey."}
{"prompt": "I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.", "completion": "But you're thieves. It's what you are."}

{"prompt": "Yes, he did.", "completion": "How'd he do?"}
{"prompt": "It feels good.", "completion": "Did Dignan take the test?"}
{"prompt": "Take a deep breath.", "completion": "How does that feel?"}
{"prompt": "The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.", "completion": "That was a test?"}
{"prompt": "Congratulations. You passed the test.", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.", "completion": "Hold it."}
{"prompt": "I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --", "completion": "As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.", "completion": "Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here."}
{"prompt": "I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --", "completion": "I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?"}
{"prompt": "So do I.", "completion": "Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.", "completion": "Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?", "completion": "You mean a safecracker?"}

{"prompt": "Grammar.", "completion": "You mean like techniques?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar."}

{"prompt": "Were you adopted, Bob?", "completion": "Why do you say that?"}

{"prompt": "Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?", "completion": "Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper."}
{"prompt": "Sixty days?", "completion": "Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend."}
{"prompt": "I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.", "completion": "At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days."}
{"prompt": "It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.", "completion": "That's pretty complicated for a senior prank."}
{"prompt": "I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.", "completion": "Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea."}

{"prompt": "I'm not playing any more golf.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Is that OK?", "completion": "Bob, where you going?"}
{"prompt": "And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?", "completion": "What?"}

{"prompt": "Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.", "completion": "I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now."}
{"prompt": "Where you going?", "completion": "Move."}
{"prompt": "I hope not.", "completion": "Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?"}
{"prompt": "There's a million places to hide around here.", "completion": "Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy."}

{"prompt": "See you, Bob.", "completion": "You'll probably have them the rest of your life."}

{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future."}

{"prompt": "What?  What?", "completion": "Like silk?"}
{"prompt": "Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?", "completion": "God, yes. Like silk."}

{"prompt": "That's Anthony.", "completion": "That's your friend Anthony?"}

{"prompt": "Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.", "completion": "That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail."}
{"prompt": "There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.", "completion": "Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense."}
{"prompt": "It seemed like a good idea at the time.", "completion": "The one and only Little Richard."}
{"prompt": "I don't know about that.", "completion": "Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets."}
{"prompt": "You're the faggot.", "completion": "Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts."}

{"prompt": "Bullshit.", "completion": "All right! Backyard! Right now!"}
{"prompt": "I never agreed to that.", "completion": "Bob, you're lying!"}

{"prompt": "Yeah. It is.", "completion": "Right. It was extremely stupid."}
{"prompt": "Not a whole lot, Bob.", "completion": "It's too bad about what happened on the road."}
{"prompt": "Not bad.", "completion": "Come on in. What you been up to?"}
{"prompt": "Anthony. Bad news.", "completion": "Hey, Dignan. How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "Let's go.", "completion": "Dignan."}
{"prompt": "That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.", "completion": "You've got a beautiful walk, Bob."}
{"prompt": "OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.", "completion": "It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan."}
{"prompt": "Just get in the car, Bob.", "completion": "What's his name?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I do.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "I know it's not.", "completion": "You don't even know his name."}

{"prompt": "I can't do that, Bob.", "completion": "Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt."}
{"prompt": "Good luck, since I got the keys.", "completion": "Give me the keys, Dignan."}
{"prompt": "Not in that car you're not.", "completion": "Watch me."}
{"prompt": "Don't \"Come on, Dignan\" me.", "completion": "I'm going back."}
{"prompt": "This could be a trap.", "completion": "Come on, Dignan."}
{"prompt": "Bob, that makes no sense.", "completion": "Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean get back?", "completion": "Well, obviously, we got to go back."}
{"prompt": "Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.", "completion": "We'll have to see when we get back."}
{"prompt": "How long has he been in there?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?", "completion": "I was just going to use it to see how much I had."}
{"prompt": "Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.", "completion": "The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana."}
{"prompt": "That could be anybody's.", "completion": "They also found my two beam scale in the garage."}
{"prompt": "I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?", "completion": "Well, the marijuana crop is a good start."}
{"prompt": "But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?", "completion": "They said he's a drug dealer."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "The weed."}
{"prompt": "You can go first, Bob.", "completion": "My brother's in jail."}
{"prompt": "Bob. Are you coming?", "completion": "See you in a little while."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck possessed you?", "completion": "You're the one who kept saying ram him."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.", "completion": "It's registered in my mother's name."}
{"prompt": "Is he chasing us?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?", "completion": "He wouldn't move."}
{"prompt": "In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?", "completion": "There were more than that."}
{"prompt": "I told you they were there.", "completion": "So it's my fault?"}
{"prompt": "Bob, I've got nightmares.", "completion": "Way to go, Bob!"}
{"prompt": "I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, \"I'm going to remember you!\"", "completion": "That's true. That would give me nightmares."}
{"prompt": "Bob, will you please listen?", "completion": "I don't want to talk about it."}
{"prompt": "You really think he'll remember you?", "completion": "No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose."}
{"prompt": "Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!", "completion": "No. I was calm."}
{"prompt": "How much is there?", "completion": "Don't count it."}
{"prompt": "Did we get it?", "completion": "Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light."}
{"prompt": "This is natural.", "completion": "That's good. Keep it at forty."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose."}
{"prompt": "That's too bad.", "completion": "You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did."}
{"prompt": "His name was Swifty?", "completion": "Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know."}
{"prompt": "He electrocuted someone?", "completion": "It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?", "completion": "You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year."}
{"prompt": "He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.", "completion": "Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing."}
{"prompt": "I paid for it.", "completion": "God DAMMIT."}
{"prompt": "What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!", "completion": "I just want to see how much bullets it takes."}
{"prompt": "Bob.", "completion": "I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute."}
{"prompt": "That's your domain.", "completion": "OK."}
{"prompt": "Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.", "completion": "That's my responsibility."}
{"prompt": "Let's just go.", "completion": "I'm going to take a look at this."}
{"prompt": "Maybe she turned.", "completion": "I think we might of scared her."}
{"prompt": "I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.", "completion": "Where'd she go?"}
{"prompt": "I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.", "completion": "Well, don't blame me. I told you."}
{"prompt": "You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.", "completion": "No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic."}
{"prompt": "The guy is fucking insane.", "completion": "I warned you, Dignan."}
{"prompt": "What did I say?", "completion": "I told you he's crazy."}
{"prompt": "What was that all about?", "completion": "I can't believe you said that."}
{"prompt": "You're paranoid, Bob.", "completion": "Yeah, but don't tell anybody."}
{"prompt": "Good question.", "completion": "Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants."}
{"prompt": "You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.", "completion": "If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?"}
{"prompt": "As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.", "completion": "Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob."}
{"prompt": "I'll just drive my car.", "completion": "How much could you grow? Realistically."}
{"prompt": "It's true, Dignan.", "completion": "Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. I did.", "completion": "OK, Bob."}
{"prompt": "Can you use a coaster.", "completion": "You stole a Trans-Am."}
{"prompt": "If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.", "completion": "What are you talking about, Bob?"}
{"prompt": "That never would of --", "completion": "Let's cut the bullshit."}
{"prompt": "My brother.", "completion": "He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare."}
{"prompt": "They are.", "completion": "So who's going to know?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I thought your parents were in Italy."}
{"prompt": "I'm not allowed to drive those.", "completion": "Not even for emergencies?"}
{"prompt": "Well, what do you think?", "completion": "I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?"}
{"prompt": "I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.", "completion": "Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about."}
{"prompt": "John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.", "completion": "I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Hey, Clay.", "completion": "I might have mentioned it."}
{"prompt": "Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.", "completion": "Fancy seeing you here, Bob."}
{"prompt": "How's that 700 bucks coming?", "completion": "I'm working on it."}
{"prompt": "He said you ran away from home.", "completion": "No. I didn't run away. I went out of town."}
{"prompt": "Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.", "completion": "He said what?"}
{"prompt": "I'm trying.", "completion": "This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Jackson. How's it going?", "completion": "You keeping out of trouble?"}
{"prompt": "Did you hear that?", "completion": "How you doing, Bob?"}
{"prompt": "Hand to hand combat?", "completion": "Ground defense."}
{"prompt": "And what does that cover?", "completion": "Social issues. Crime prevention."}
{"prompt": "How long do you have to go?", "completion": "26 weeks."}
{"prompt": "Well, I think --", "completion": "No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "We're just going over a few things.", "completion": "You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "He's damn good.", "completion": "Join the party, fellas."}
{"prompt": "You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.", "completion": "Is he good?"}
{"prompt": "Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.", "completion": "Oh, yeah."}

{"prompt": "You got that?", "completion": "Where did he go?"}
{"prompt": "Where is he? Where is Rob?", "completion": "I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "In the cash register. Step away from the door."}
{"prompt": "He left his sweater.", "completion": "Well, I left some money in there."}
{"prompt": "We're closed, sir.", "completion": "Where's that guy going?"}

{"prompt": "He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.", "completion": "Bourne comes here? Why?"}
{"prompt": "Save it for Bourne.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you."}
{"prompt": "One last push. One.", "completion": "Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it."}
{"prompt": "Anything else?", "completion": "Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push."}
{"prompt": "And the Landy woman?", "completion": "She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account..."}
{"prompt": "Will it track back to us?", "completion": "No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse."}
{"prompt": "There was a mistake.", "completion": "I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak."}
{"prompt": "Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.", "completion": "You told me Bourne was dead."}
{"prompt": "In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.", "completion": "No. You lost your way."}
{"prompt": "Had to be done.", "completion": "No good options left?"}
{"prompt": "Why not? It was just money.", "completion": "And Danny Zorn, what was that?"}

{"prompt": "Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?", "completion": "Don't know."}
{"prompt": "Did he say anything to you?", "completion": "No... It must have been Bourne."}
{"prompt": "They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.", "completion": "Oh, God... It must have been Bourne."}
{"prompt": "I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.", "completion": "Sorry to wake you."}
{"prompt": "So what's he doing? You believe him?", "completion": "It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear..."}
{"prompt": "Don't you want answers?", "completion": "There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?"}
{"prompt": "Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.", "completion": "My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him."}
{"prompt": "And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...", "completion": "Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?"}
{"prompt": "I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.", "completion": "You don't know what you're getting into here."}
{"prompt": "So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.", "completion": "Berlin!"}
{"prompt": "Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?", "completion": "What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!"}
{"prompt": "We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.", "completion": "May I finish?"}
{"prompt": "Do you know what his budget was?", "completion": "Excuse me."}
{"prompt": "...this is Conklin's computer.", "completion": "...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars."}
{"prompt": "I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.", "completion": "...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This..."}
{"prompt": "And Bourne? Where's he now?", "completion": "Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?"}
{"prompt": "So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...", "completion": "I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done."}
{"prompt": "I want to know what happened.", "completion": "What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left."}
{"prompt": "Let's talk about Conklin.", "completion": "What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?"}
{"prompt": "To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.", "completion": "He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward."}
{"prompt": "And what are we looking for?", "completion": "I want to know about Treadstone."}
{"prompt": "That's not gonna fly.", "completion": "With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade."}
{"prompt": "Treadstone.", "completion": "Never heard of it."}
{"prompt": "Show me again...", "completion": "Okay..."}
{"prompt": "Who else knows about this?", "completion": "Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?"}
{"prompt": "Lots of people...", "completion": "Including Landy...  She had access to the archives."}
{"prompt": "Keep going...", "completion": "Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus...", "completion": "Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?"}
{"prompt": "It was staged?", "completion": "Is it a slam dunk? No, but..."}
{"prompt": "And?", "completion": "There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know."}
{"prompt": "What do you have, Danny?", "completion": "You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it."}
{"prompt": "The sooner the better.", "completion": "I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "She say what time I should call?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "Sir..."}
{"prompt": "I have to go now.", "completion": "Is this really happening?"}
{"prompt": "Because you're afraid!", "completion": "No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels."}
{"prompt": "I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!", "completion": "I can't let you do that either."}

{"prompt": "They loved you.  And I killed them.", "completion": "How... how can... how can you be here and say this?"}
{"prompt": "It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.", "completion": "You killed them."}
{"prompt": "Then what?", "completion": "I killed them."}
{"prompt": "Yes...", "completion": "That's not what happened to your parents."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?"}
{"prompt": "No, I do.", "completion": "I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself."}
{"prompt": "It's nothing. It's just a picture.", "completion": "No. It's because you don't know how they died."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?"}
{"prompt": "I speak English.", "completion": "Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here."}

{"prompt": "-- my coat -- but we should --", "completion": "-- what? --"}
{"prompt": "How long? How long do I have --", "completion": "-- car keys?"}
{"prompt": "You called it in?", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...", "completion": "I did."}
{"prompt": "What's going on in Berlin?", "completion": "I don't know! Why would I lie?"}
{"prompt": "Pamela Landy?", "completion": "I don't know who that is."}
{"prompt": "Who sent you to Greece?", "completion": "A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new."}
{"prompt": "You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Try again.", "completion": "Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out."}
{"prompt": "Conklin.", "completion": "He's dead."}
{"prompt": "She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.", "completion": "What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.", "completion": "So why didn't you kill me then?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry. Old habits.", "completion": "You still should've moved."}

{"prompt": "It might have.", "completion": "I know it's a dream."}
{"prompt": "I did.", "completion": "It wouldn't have changed the way you feel."}

{"prompt": "He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...", "completion": "So when was I here?"}
{"prompt": "Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --", "completion": "Abbott?"}

{"prompt": "I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.", "completion": "What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?"}
{"prompt": "I killed him???", "completion": "You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!"}
{"prompt": "Last week? When?", "completion": "And you got to him before we could."}
{"prompt": "A Russian?", "completion": "It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was."}

{"prompt": "What is this, a game?", "completion": "I want to hear it from you."}

{"prompt": "For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.", "completion": "Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?"}

{"prompt": "Did you?", "completion": "These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans."}
{"prompt": "You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?", "completion": "You mean, did I want a date?"}
{"prompt": "Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?", "completion": "You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice."}

{"prompt": "What are they doing?", "completion": "Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes."}
{"prompt": "It was in Latin, sir.", "completion": "Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite."}
{"prompt": "Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.", "completion": "Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?"}
{"prompt": "We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.", "completion": "I don't want to leave."}
{"prompt": "I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.", "completion": "He has already agreed to come."}
{"prompt": "So let the council swear publicly.", "completion": "We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one."}
{"prompt": "You've all sworn to Longshanks.", "completion": "An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you."}
{"prompt": "It is suicide.", "completion": "Sir William. We come to seek a meeting."}
{"prompt": "We cannot defeat this --", "completion": "With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!"}
{"prompt": "We must sue for peace.", "completion": "Peace?!"}
{"prompt": "Invade?! That's impossible, it --", "completion": "A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face."}
{"prompt": "But... what will you do?", "completion": "I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground."}
{"prompt": "Longshanks promised!", "completion": "You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king."}
{"prompt": "He won't come.", "completion": "He will. I know he will."}
{"prompt": "The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.", "completion": "That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace."}
{"prompt": "If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?", "completion": "Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!"}
{"prompt": "He was a modest man.", "completion": "It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear."}
{"prompt": "No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.", "completion": "May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?"}
{"prompt": "He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.", "completion": "Does anyone know his politics?"}
{"prompt": "Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.", "completion": "A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council."}
{"prompt": "Young Robert, we are honored --", "completion": "My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes."}
{"prompt": "His legend grows! It will be worse than before!", "completion": "You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this."}
{"prompt": "But if we have not caught Wallace --", "completion": "He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?"}
{"prompt": "The Scots will fight for us?", "completion": "What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve."}
{"prompt": "So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.", "completion": "Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France."}
{"prompt": "Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.", "completion": "The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!"}
{"prompt": "I have ordered conscriptions...", "completion": "Wallace has sacked York!"}
{"prompt": "Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.", "completion": "While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!"}
{"prompt": "I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.", "completion": "What news of the north?"}
{"prompt": "Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.", "completion": "Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!"}
{"prompt": "I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.", "completion": "Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love."}
{"prompt": "I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.", "completion": "You fancy him."}
{"prompt": "When will his trial be?", "completion": "Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed."}
{"prompt": "Is it true? Wallace is captured?", "completion": "Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation."}
{"prompt": "The little cow is insane --", "completion": "Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush."}
{"prompt": "Wallace's followers.", "completion": "Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way."}
{"prompt": "You mock us with a smile?", "completion": "I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion."}
{"prompt": "You may.", "completion": "Good day to you, M'Lords."}
{"prompt": "Now, my flower, do you understand?", "completion": "Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord."}
{"prompt": "No, M'lord.", "completion": "Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!"}
{"prompt": "...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --", "completion": "All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!"}
{"prompt": "Scotland. He intends --", "completion": "Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!"}
{"prompt": "You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.", "completion": "So I did! And what was so important about it?"}
{"prompt": "No. One of us is enough.", "completion": "What is it?!"}
{"prompt": "My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.", "completion": "Keep these. We're going too."}
{"prompt": "We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!", "completion": "Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?"}
{"prompt": "Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.", "completion": "That's just a dream, William!"}
{"prompt": "Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.", "completion": "I don't want to be a martyr."}
{"prompt": "Your rest is making me exhausted.", "completion": "You know it's a trap."}
{"prompt": "Rest, William.", "completion": "I rest."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.", "completion": "We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya."}
{"prompt": "Stephen ready?", "completion": "Aye."}
{"prompt": "The Bruce is not coming, William.", "completion": "Mornay has come. So will the Bruce."}
{"prompt": "We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.", "completion": "Fourteen? --"}
{"prompt": "I'll wait... back there.", "completion": "Hamish, I... thank..."}
{"prompt": "Good to see you again.", "completion": "I should'a remembered the eggs."}
{"prompt": "You'll move", "completion": "I will not."}
{"prompt": "Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?", "completion": "I could crush you like a roach."}
{"prompt": "I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.", "completion": "That depends on the man."}
{"prompt": "Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.", "completion": "The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here."}
{"prompt": "Test of manhood.", "completion": "You win."}
{"prompt": "We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.", "completion": "Aye, we'll get 'em."}
{"prompt": "Wanna stay with me tonight?", "completion": "I wanna have supper waitin'."}
{"prompt": "With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!", "completion": "It's up to us, Hamish!"}
{"prompt": "Armed?", "completion": "They're English soldiers, ain't they?"}
{"prompt": "How many?", "completion": "Three, maybe more!"}
{"prompt": "They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!", "completion": "They're coming!"}
{"prompt": "We must run in different directions!", "completion": "We don't split up!"}
{"prompt": "A common thief.", "completion": "A patriot!"}
{"prompt": "In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.", "completion": "Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity."}
{"prompt": "All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?", "completion": "Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?"}
{"prompt": "In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.", "completion": "All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make."}
{"prompt": "He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.", "completion": "We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve."}
{"prompt": "He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.", "completion": "So more men were slaughtered uselessly!"}
{"prompt": "He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.", "completion": "I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine."}
{"prompt": "I have faced him. Have you?", "completion": "Let her speak."}
{"prompt": "Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.", "completion": "My greatness is better demonstrated with this."}
{"prompt": "No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.", "completion": "This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool."}
{"prompt": "The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.", "completion": "Humbly, M'lord."}
{"prompt": "You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?", "completion": "...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord."}
{"prompt": "Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.", "completion": "He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him."}
{"prompt": "My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.", "completion": "No. He did not."}
{"prompt": "Shall I leave, M'lord?", "completion": "If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him."}
{"prompt": "Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.", "completion": "I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!"}
{"prompt": "Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.", "completion": "Where is my son?"}
{"prompt": "Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!", "completion": "I do not confess."}
{"prompt": "It matters not, he is thy king!", "completion": "-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!"}
{"prompt": "Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?", "completion": "Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --"}
{"prompt": "...Tonight!", "completion": "Treason. Against whom?"}
{"prompt": "My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!", "completion": "Then when?"}
{"prompt": "Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.", "completion": "Tonight then."}
{"prompt": "I will be with you, like this. Forever.", "completion": "I've missed you."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.", "completion": "This night is too beautiful to have again."}
{"prompt": "But I won't give you up to any nobleman.", "completion": "You scare me."}
{"prompt": "I'm not just saying it!", "completion": "Nor I!"}
{"prompt": "I want... to marry you!", "completion": "I... accept your proposal!"}
{"prompt": "Did it work?", "completion": "No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you."}
{"prompt": "You've been here before?", "completion": "Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure."}
{"prompt": "I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.", "completion": "You are. And I'll come again."}
{"prompt": "Thank you for accepting.", "completion": "Thank you for inviting."}
{"prompt": "Your father doesn't like me, does he?", "completion": "It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long."}
{"prompt": "I need you so much! I love you!", "completion": "Wake up, William. Wake up!"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.", "completion": "And I with you. But you must wake."}
{"prompt": "I'm dreaming.", "completion": "Yes, you are. And you must wake."}
{"prompt": "Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?", "completion": "...I wouldn't know."}
{"prompt": "This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?", "completion": "A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did."}
{"prompt": "He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.", "completion": "Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for."}
{"prompt": "How do you know this?", "completion": "Last night I slept with a member of the War Council."}
{"prompt": "I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!", "completion": "When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north."}
{"prompt": "Drink this! It will dull your pain.", "completion": "It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me."}
{"prompt": "You will die! It will be awful!", "completion": "Every man dies. Not every man really lives."}
{"prompt": "Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.", "completion": "If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.", "completion": "Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?"}
{"prompt": "No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?", "completion": "M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger."}
{"prompt": "You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?", "completion": "I cannot love you for the sake of revenge."}
{"prompt": "You have... you have a husband.", "completion": "I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises."}
{"prompt": "Why did you?", "completion": "Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met."}
{"prompt": "A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.", "completion": "It does me good to see you."}
{"prompt": "I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.", "completion": "She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant."}
{"prompt": "Peace is made is such ways.", "completion": "SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!"}
{"prompt": "Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.", "completion": "A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas."}
{"prompt": "York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.", "completion": "That is not possible."}
{"prompt": "I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.", "completion": "Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?"}
{"prompt": "But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?", "completion": "I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight."}
{"prompt": "I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.", "completion": "It's battle I want, not talk."}
{"prompt": "I am the Princess of Wales.", "completion": "Wife of Edward, the king's son?"}
{"prompt": "I must... consult with my father.", "completion": "And I will consult with mine."}
{"prompt": "I am trying.", "completion": "Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it."}
{"prompt": "Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.", "completion": "War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you."}
{"prompt": "We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.", "completion": "I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles."}
{"prompt": "And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?", "completion": "No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead."}
{"prompt": "Aye. But it won't let me dream.", "completion": "Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk."}
{"prompt": "Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.", "completion": "Come, it'll help you sleep."}
{"prompt": "No English lord would trust an Irishman!", "completion": "Fine speech. Now what do we do?"}
{"prompt": "Exactly.", "completion": "I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!"}
{"prompt": "The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.", "completion": "Who would do such a thing?"}
{"prompt": "They've tricked us.", "completion": "What's the crazy man saying, Lord?"}
{"prompt": "When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.", "completion": "We can't stop!"}
{"prompt": "Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...", "completion": "Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?"}
{"prompt": "I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!", "completion": "I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --"}
{"prompt": "No dances, just tell me.", "completion": "The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions."}
{"prompt": "Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.", "completion": "So what did you find."}
{"prompt": "Evan wake up, oh please wake up!", "completion": "Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!"}
{"prompt": "It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.", "completion": "How soon?..."}
{"prompt": "You'd be surprised how often they are.", "completion": "Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off."}
{"prompt": "Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.", "completion": "Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple."}
{"prompt": "If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.", "completion": "But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?"}
{"prompt": "Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.", "completion": "But you must have something to go on?"}
{"prompt": "Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...", "completion": "And the bad news?"}
{"prompt": "Why? What for?", "completion": "It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days."}
{"prompt": "Anything.", "completion": "A journal. Just have him write down everything he does."}
{"prompt": "Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...", "completion": "Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory."}
{"prompt": "Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?", "completion": "Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.", "completion": "And you say he doesn't remember any of it?"}
{"prompt": "You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.", "completion": "Just. Like. Jason."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.", "completion": "How. Did you. Know that?"}
{"prompt": "I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.", "completion": "You're. Acting. Like your father."}
{"prompt": "There must be a way to fix this.", "completion": "Fix?"}
{"prompt": "What does that mean for Evan?", "completion": "He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?", "completion": "Cute, Evan."}
{"prompt": "Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!", "completion": "Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now."}
{"prompt": "How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?", "completion": "I found these. The others are still in storage."}
{"prompt": "How long will I be in here?", "completion": "I don't know. These things take time."}
{"prompt": "What? What could he do?", "completion": "...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient."}
{"prompt": "Sure...", "completion": "And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could..."}
{"prompt": "When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.", "completion": "I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them..."}
{"prompt": "Why do you ask?", "completion": "No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten."}
{"prompt": "Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.", "completion": "Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?"}
{"prompt": "I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.", "completion": "Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?"}
{"prompt": "Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!", "completion": "Please, mom. People will talk."}
{"prompt": "Something must've happened! What set him off?", "completion": "I... I blacked out."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "I don't know... I don't remember."}
{"prompt": "I... I don't remember.", "completion": "Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?"}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "Honey. What were you doing with that?"}
{"prompt": "These'll bring you luck, Crockett.", "completion": "Great. I'll see you soon."}
{"prompt": "That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.", "completion": "My father has a bad memory, too?"}
{"prompt": "I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!", "completion": "You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there."}
{"prompt": "All the dads are gonna be there.", "completion": "I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?"}
{"prompt": "We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.", "completion": "But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad..."}
{"prompt": "You know the answer to that.", "completion": "Can't he come out for one day?"}
{"prompt": "Darn it!", "completion": "Um... can dad come this time?"}
{"prompt": "Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.", "completion": "Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time."}
{"prompt": "When did you ever care about getting to school on time?", "completion": "We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night."}
{"prompt": "So you believe me?", "completion": "We're gonna be late again."}
{"prompt": "What did you see? What did it look like?", "completion": "Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!"}
{"prompt": "Weirder than this?", "completion": "Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess."}
{"prompt": "You need to see the prison shrink, man.", "completion": "Just tell me if anything weird happens."}
{"prompt": "I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.", "completion": "So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely."}
{"prompt": "Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.", "completion": "Shit. I knew you were crazy."}
{"prompt": "You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about \"the Lord works in mysterious ways?\"", "completion": "Straight up."}
{"prompt": "Can you protect me?", "completion": "Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "Photos?", "completion": "Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way."}
{"prompt": "But I... I need those books.", "completion": "You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one."}
{"prompt": "My journals! Where are they?", "completion": "Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia..."}
{"prompt": "Where are my goddamn books?", "completion": "Books?"}
{"prompt": "Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?", "completion": "Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour."}
{"prompt": "Are you sure? Not even with my father?", "completion": "This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex."}
{"prompt": "It's coming... argh! I can't!", "completion": "It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before."}
{"prompt": "I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.", "completion": "The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car."}
{"prompt": "I see a car.", "completion": "Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe."}
{"prompt": "No, protecting her.", "completion": "Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?"}
{"prompt": "I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.", "completion": "Are you hurting her?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Where are you now?"}
{"prompt": "Not in this wing, actually. No.", "completion": "Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?"}
{"prompt": "You know my father?", "completion": "Dad lives here?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.", "completion": "Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father."}
{"prompt": "Fuck off, frat boy.", "completion": "Get out. Both of you."}
{"prompt": "Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!"}
{"prompt": "Shhh! I need quiet for this.", "completion": "Are you stupid or what?"}
{"prompt": "I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --", "completion": "What the fuck are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "You really think he wanted to kill you?", "completion": "All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories."}
{"prompt": "Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.", "completion": "That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart."}
{"prompt": "It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.", "completion": "Like Ozzy."}
{"prompt": "I thought you were a December baby.", "completion": "This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts."}
{"prompt": "Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.", "completion": "Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday."}
{"prompt": "Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.", "completion": "Then you think it might have worked out?"}
{"prompt": "It's crossed my mind from time to time.", "completion": "And...?"}
{"prompt": "When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.", "completion": "I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?"}
{"prompt": "That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.", "completion": "I don't get it."}
{"prompt": "Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.", "completion": "I was?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.", "completion": "Kayleigh? Do you ever think about \"us?\" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"}
{"prompt": "He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.", "completion": "Is something the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Stop! Take me back!", "completion": "You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie."}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages."}
{"prompt": "I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.", "completion": "Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family."}
{"prompt": "Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.", "completion": "Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act."}
{"prompt": "There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.", "completion": "Sure you don't want your wallet?"}
{"prompt": "There's one major hole in your story.", "completion": "Which is?"}
{"prompt": "Know what?", "completion": "That I didn't leave you there to rot."}
{"prompt": "Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.", "completion": "I just thought you should know."}
{"prompt": "Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?", "completion": "Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that."}
{"prompt": "I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.", "completion": "Oh? There's proof now?"}
{"prompt": "I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.", "completion": "I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?"}
{"prompt": "Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?", "completion": "You're right, Evan, I don't believe you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch."}
{"prompt": "Different? How?", "completion": "Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years."}
{"prompt": "Why's that?", "completion": "Because you're... different."}
{"prompt": "You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, \"You wouldn't believe me\", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.", "completion": "I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case."}
{"prompt": "The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.", "completion": "What's happened to you?"}
{"prompt": "No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.", "completion": "Ha! Where's that?"}
{"prompt": "I get it. You can drop it now.", "completion": "Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?"}
{"prompt": "Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?", "completion": "So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor."}
{"prompt": "Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --", "completion": "Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone."}
{"prompt": "I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --", "completion": "Evan. Stop it. It's not the time."}
{"prompt": "Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!", "completion": "He's a fucking maniac!"}
{"prompt": "Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...", "completion": "I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.", "completion": "I walk differently?"}
{"prompt": "It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?", "completion": "Like how?"}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.", "completion": "My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.", "completion": "It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids."}
{"prompt": "Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.", "completion": "Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me."}
{"prompt": "Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.", "completion": "It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago."}
{"prompt": "Go on. Sit down.", "completion": "Why are you doing all this for me?"}
{"prompt": "You'll see.", "completion": "I don't know what to say. It's beautiful."}
{"prompt": "As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?", "completion": "I don't understand, where are you taking me?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.", "completion": "What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?"}
{"prompt": "Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?", "completion": "So it didn't feel... weird?"}
{"prompt": "Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?", "completion": "I dunno.  Just being weird."}
{"prompt": "Those are your clothes, silly.", "completion": "Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?"}
{"prompt": "Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.", "completion": "Where... where are my clothes?"}
{"prompt": "Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!", "completion": "Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible."}
{"prompt": "Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.", "completion": "You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak."}
{"prompt": "Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?", "completion": "No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us."}
{"prompt": "It was a long time ago.", "completion": "I know, but..."}
{"prompt": "What do you want to know, Evan?", "completion": "It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?"}
{"prompt": "Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.", "completion": "When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?"}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help."}
{"prompt": "Me? Are you kidding? Why?", "completion": "Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?"}
{"prompt": "She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.", "completion": "Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "Not if you remember my dad.", "completion": "Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?"}
{"prompt": "No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.", "completion": "Wow. That must've taken some courage."}
{"prompt": "So how's Tommy?", "completion": "They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody."}
{"prompt": "Not since we were kids.", "completion": "I've stopped a hundred times."}
{"prompt": "No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.", "completion": "I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good..."}
{"prompt": "God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?", "completion": "Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know..."}
{"prompt": "Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.", "completion": "Hi, Lenny."}
{"prompt": "Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?", "completion": "He must be. They're letting him go, right?"}
{"prompt": "He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.", "completion": "Duck, here they come."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.", "completion": "I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?"}
{"prompt": "Damn. Your dad did this?", "completion": "I deserve a lot worse."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny."}
{"prompt": "You really don't remember anything that happened?", "completion": "Ouch."}
{"prompt": "Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!", "completion": "I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea."}
{"prompt": "So let's go. This place creeps me out.", "completion": "Oh God... what did we do?"}
{"prompt": "Been there, done that.", "completion": "We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead."}
{"prompt": "And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!", "completion": "That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!"}
{"prompt": "Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.", "completion": "Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty."}
{"prompt": "Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?", "completion": "...yes."}
{"prompt": "It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.", "completion": "Who -- who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.", "completion": "What's happened to -- How are you doing that?"}
{"prompt": "What time is it?", "completion": "It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you."}
{"prompt": "Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.", "completion": "Kayleigh? What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Calm down, kid. Stand still.", "completion": "I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?"}
{"prompt": "That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.", "completion": "Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?"}
{"prompt": "Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.", "completion": "We're really gonna be in a movie!?"}
{"prompt": "Who's to say you can't make things better?", "completion": "You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother."}
{"prompt": "But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.", "completion": "There is no \"right\". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."}
{"prompt": "Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.", "completion": "I was praying this curse would have ended with me."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --", "completion": "Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there."}
{"prompt": "I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.", "completion": "It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?"}
{"prompt": "Damn, Evan, on the D.L.", "completion": "Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers..."}
{"prompt": "Me neither.", "completion": "You're kidding. Are these the answers?!"}
{"prompt": "Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?", "completion": "We'll find out soon enough."}
{"prompt": "Evan Treborn.", "completion": "The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin."}
{"prompt": "I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?", "completion": "And you are...?"}
{"prompt": "I won't let you down, Professor Carter.", "completion": "Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due."}
{"prompt": "I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?", "completion": "Just don't drop the ball, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.", "completion": "Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't..."}
{"prompt": "Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?", "completion": "Hey, I got no choice."}
{"prompt": "Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?", "completion": "I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?"}
{"prompt": "It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.", "completion": "It didn't feel like a dream."}
{"prompt": "Deal. Now read me something.", "completion": "Come on, go on..."}
{"prompt": "Wow... read something.", "completion": "Freeze! No \"worm-boy\". No \"Mr. Worm,\" and no \"Worm-Master-General!\" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.", "completion": "Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven."}
{"prompt": "Thumper had a busy afternoon.", "completion": "You're kidding. He's so... big."}
{"prompt": "Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.", "completion": "Smells like sex in here."}
{"prompt": "If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.", "completion": "So what's the point?"}
{"prompt": "Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.", "completion": "Destroy it?"}
{"prompt": "Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.", "completion": "What do you need it for? I don't get you lately."}
{"prompt": "Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.", "completion": "Are you sure you even packed it?"}
{"prompt": "Y... yes. I guess I did.", "completion": "Uh, we should be getting to class now."}
{"prompt": "Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.", "completion": "You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!"}
{"prompt": "I couldn't cut the rope.", "completion": "Yeah, good, what else do you remember?"}
{"prompt": "That should buy you ten minutes at least.", "completion": "Gee, thanks friend."}
{"prompt": "Can... can... Can I have this?", "completion": "Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway."}
{"prompt": "Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.", "completion": "I think I'll go check out the chapel."}
{"prompt": "Lung cancer?", "completion": "Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately."}
{"prompt": "I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.", "completion": "Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke."}
{"prompt": "Listen to me good, Evan...", "completion": "I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father."}
{"prompt": "No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.", "completion": "Right, Evan. I believe you just said \"sick fuck.\""}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you doing?", "completion": "It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit."}
{"prompt": "Leave us alone you sick fuck!", "completion": "Get this \"us\" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself."}
{"prompt": "Look what you made me do!", "completion": "What's wrong with you?!"}
{"prompt": "Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!", "completion": "What happened?? Where are we?!"}
{"prompt": "Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?", "completion": "Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid."}
{"prompt": "Hey, what'd you do that for?", "completion": "Fat little baby, crying for mommy."}
{"prompt": "None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?", "completion": "Sorry. Never heard of her."}
{"prompt": "I come from a big family.", "completion": "Meant no offense."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that."}
{"prompt": "Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.", "completion": "Just get out, didja?"}
{"prompt": "Oh my God oh my God...", "completion": "Shut up, Tommy!"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "Lenny? Come on!"}
{"prompt": "Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.", "completion": "Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?"}
{"prompt": "What did I say about mentioning that bitch?", "completion": "Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already."}
{"prompt": "I thought I was the bad guy!", "completion": "You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff."}
{"prompt": "I don't think Evan gets to be in it --", "completion": "Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you do that, Lenny.", "completion": "Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie."}
{"prompt": "Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.", "completion": "Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?"}
{"prompt": "What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.", "completion": "The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure."}
{"prompt": "You're such a retard!", "completion": "Here you go, buddy."}
{"prompt": "-- He's just a lucky guy.", "completion": "You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it."}
{"prompt": "Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.", "completion": "Monsieur Rick, I --"}
{"prompt": "Go back to Bulgaria.", "completion": "Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is."}
{"prompt": "You want my advice?", "completion": "Oh, yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Nobody ever loved me that much.", "completion": "And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?"}
{"prompt": "-- Will he keep his word?", "completion": "He always has."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Monsieur.", "completion": "And you want to know --"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes.", "completion": "And he is still willing to give you a visa?"}
{"prompt": "He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.", "completion": "Does he know that?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.", "completion": "Yes, I'll bet."}
{"prompt": "Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.", "completion": "So you decided to go to America."}
{"prompt": "At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.", "completion": "How long have you been married?"}
{"prompt": "He did. Captain Renault did.", "completion": "I thought so. Where's your husband?"}
{"prompt": "No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --", "completion": "-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?"}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?", "completion": "Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so."}
{"prompt": "No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "My husband is with me, too.", "completion": "He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?"}
{"prompt": "I came with Captain Renault.", "completion": "I should have known."}
{"prompt": "Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?", "completion": "How did you get in here? You're under age."}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Rick?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come..."}
{"prompt": "We read five times that you were killed in five different places.", "completion": "As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me."}
{"prompt": "I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.", "completion": "In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Monsieur.", "completion": "A champagne cocktail, please."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. It is.", "completion": "Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?"}
{"prompt": "Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.", "completion": "Such a bargain. But that is your decision?"}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "What is your name?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, but I hardly think --", "completion": "-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique."}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I come, I will do it.", "completion": "I want you to take Miss Lund home."}
{"prompt": "But Sacha always puts out that light --", "completion": "-- Tonight he forgot."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I come.", "completion": "I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police."}
{"prompt": "The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.", "completion": "Come up here a minute."}
{"prompt": "Goodnight.", "completion": "Goodnight, Monsieur Rick."}
{"prompt": "-- Don't tell me where you're going.", "completion": "I won't."}
{"prompt": "Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?", "completion": "I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --"}
{"prompt": "Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.", "completion": "Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money."}
{"prompt": "How long can I afford to stay closed?", "completion": "Oh, two weeks, maybe three."}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Rick!", "completion": "Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick."}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?", "completion": "No thanks, Carl."}
{"prompt": "It shall not happen again, Monsieur.", "completion": "That's all right."}
{"prompt": "I'm awfully sorry.", "completion": "Here you are."}
{"prompt": "I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --", "completion": "-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.", "completion": "Well, I'll get it from the safe."}
{"prompt": "Er, goodbye, sir.", "completion": "It has been a pleasure to meet you."}
{"prompt": "Er, my check, please.", "completion": "I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you..."}
{"prompt": "Er, good luck, yes.", "completion": "I'd better be going."}
{"prompt": "I shall remember to pay it... to myself.", "completion": "Here's to you, sir."}
{"prompt": "Well, so long.", "completion": "Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes."}
{"prompt": "And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.", "completion": "Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them."}
{"prompt": "Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.", "completion": "Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five."}
{"prompt": "It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.", "completion": "Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man."}
{"prompt": "Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.", "completion": "Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.", "completion": "That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place."}
{"prompt": "I'll tell him when he comes in.", "completion": "Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are."}
{"prompt": "And the carrying charges?", "completion": "Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters."}
{"prompt": "So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.", "completion": "I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage."}
{"prompt": "Practically no one.", "completion": "If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune."}
{"prompt": "You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.", "completion": "Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are."}
{"prompt": "Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.", "completion": "The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much."}
{"prompt": "No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.", "completion": "I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short."}
{"prompt": "My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?", "completion": "I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me."}
{"prompt": "Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.", "completion": "Suppose we do."}
{"prompt": "That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.", "completion": "Suppose you run your business and let me run mine."}
{"prompt": "What do you want for Sam?", "completion": "I don't buy or sell human beings."}
{"prompt": "You haven't heard my offer.", "completion": "It's not for sale at any price."}
{"prompt": "Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.", "completion": "It's not for sale."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Rick.", "completion": "Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?"}
{"prompt": "It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.", "completion": "Good day."}
{"prompt": "He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.", "completion": "Thank you very much. Good day."}
{"prompt": "Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.", "completion": "Rick?"}
{"prompt": "Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.", "completion": "Do you know where they are?"}
{"prompt": "I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?", "completion": "Yes, something."}
{"prompt": "We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.", "completion": "Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?"}
{"prompt": "I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --", "completion": "-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles."}
{"prompt": "As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.", "completion": "Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you."}
{"prompt": "My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.", "completion": "You see, my dear, the word has gone around."}
{"prompt": "It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.", "completion": "And the other alternative?"}
{"prompt": "There are only two other alternatives for him.", "completion": "What are they?"}
{"prompt": "Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.", "completion": "What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past."}
{"prompt": "That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.", "completion": "Occupied France?"}
{"prompt": "Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.", "completion": "This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca."}
{"prompt": "And Mademoiselle?", "completion": "You needn't be concerned about me."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend."}
{"prompt": "And I said I would never leave you.", "completion": "And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now..."}
{"prompt": "But what about us?", "completion": "We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life."}
{"prompt": "-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?", "completion": "I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it."}
{"prompt": "-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.", "completion": "But Richard, no, I, I --"}
{"prompt": "I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.", "completion": "No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --"}
{"prompt": "Because you're getting on that plane.", "completion": "I don't understand. What about you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Rick!", "completion": "But why my name, Richard?"}
{"prompt": "But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?", "completion": "Everything is quite all right."}
{"prompt": "Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?", "completion": "No, not yet."}
{"prompt": "All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.", "completion": "I wish I didn't love you so much."}
{"prompt": "All except one. He won't have you.", "completion": "I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us."}
{"prompt": "And Laszlo?", "completion": "Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for."}
{"prompt": "Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?", "completion": "Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again."}
{"prompt": "When did you first find out he was alive?", "completion": "Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest."}
{"prompt": "Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?", "completion": "Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me."}
{"prompt": "And then?", "completion": "It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: \"Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp.\" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."}
{"prompt": "For the last time, put them on the table.", "completion": "If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you."}
{"prompt": "Put them on the table.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.", "completion": "I don't have to. I've got them right here."}
{"prompt": "No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.", "completion": "What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it."}
{"prompt": "Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --", "completion": "-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want."}
{"prompt": "Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --", "completion": "-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship."}
{"prompt": "It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.", "completion": "I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in."}
{"prompt": "I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.", "completion": "Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?"}
{"prompt": "You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.", "completion": "I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal."}
{"prompt": "Please.", "completion": "Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely."}
{"prompt": "Richard, I had to see you.", "completion": "You use \"Richard\" again? We're back in Paris."}
{"prompt": "The stairs from the street.", "completion": "I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?"}
{"prompt": "No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.", "completion": "How did you get in?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.", "completion": "All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there."}
{"prompt": "Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?", "completion": "You can believe that if you want to."}
{"prompt": "Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.", "completion": "Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night."}
{"prompt": "Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.", "completion": "I don't think I will, Rick."}
{"prompt": "Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.", "completion": "It doesn't matter."}
{"prompt": "It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.", "completion": "Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, \"Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,\" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know the finish yet.", "completion": "Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along."}
{"prompt": "Can I tell you a story, Rick?", "completion": "Has it got a wow finish?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't count the days.", "completion": "Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out."}
{"prompt": "Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.", "completion": "Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?"}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.", "completion": "It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. \"Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop.\""}
{"prompt": "Please.", "completion": "Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places."}
{"prompt": "No. No, Rick. Not tonight.", "completion": "Especially tonight."}
{"prompt": "I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...", "completion": "Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here."}
{"prompt": "Oh, darling!", "completion": "Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?"}
{"prompt": "That's too far ahead to plan.", "completion": "Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?"}
{"prompt": "No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?", "completion": "All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, of course, we --", "completion": "-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty."}
{"prompt": "But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.", "completion": "No, no, no, no. We must leave."}
{"prompt": "Strange. I know so very little about you.", "completion": "I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened."}
{"prompt": "Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?", "completion": "Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away."}
{"prompt": "Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?", "completion": "Looking for a job."}
{"prompt": "With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.", "completion": "Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?"}
{"prompt": "My German's a little rusty.", "completion": "It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.", "completion": "I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said \"no questions.\"", "completion": "Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions."}
{"prompt": "Uh huh.", "completion": "That's easy. There was. He's dead."}
{"prompt": "Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.", "completion": "Why there is no other man in my life?"}
{"prompt": "And I was wondering.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.", "completion": "I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me."}
{"prompt": "Here's looking at you, kid.", "completion": "A franc for your thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?", "completion": "We said \"no questions.\""}
{"prompt": "There's still nobody in the world who can play \"As Time Goes By\" like Sam.", "completion": "He hasn't played it in a long time."}
{"prompt": "Say goodnight to Sam for me.", "completion": "I will."}
{"prompt": "I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.", "completion": "Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again."}
{"prompt": "Not an easy day to forget.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "-- It was \"La Belle Aurore.\"", "completion": "How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris."}
{"prompt": "Play it, Sam. Play \"As Time Goes By.\"", "completion": "Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it."}
{"prompt": "Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.", "completion": "I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa."}
{"prompt": "You used to be a much better liar, Sam.", "completion": "Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him."}
{"prompt": "Does he always leave so early?", "completion": "Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time."}
{"prompt": "When will he be back?", "completion": "Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home."}
{"prompt": "Where is Rick?", "completion": "I don't know. I ain't seen him all night."}
{"prompt": "Some of the old songs, Sam.", "completion": "Yes, ma'am."}
{"prompt": "It's been a long time.", "completion": "Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Sam.", "completion": "Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again."}
{"prompt": "Are you ready Ilsa?", "completion": "Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Be careful.", "completion": "Of course, I'll be careful."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --", "completion": "-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear."}
{"prompt": "No, Victor, there isn't.", "completion": "I love you very much, my dear."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Victor, I was.", "completion": "I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?"}
{"prompt": "-- Yes?", "completion": "When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. He said, \"Ask your wife.\" I don't know why he said that.", "completion": "Ilsa, I --"}
{"prompt": "He suggested I ask you.", "completion": "Ask me?"}
{"prompt": "But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.", "completion": "Did he give any reason?"}
{"prompt": "Apparently he has the letters.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?", "completion": "Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?"}
{"prompt": "I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.", "completion": "Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened."}
{"prompt": "Our faithful friend is still there.", "completion": "Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight."}
{"prompt": "What happened with Rick?", "completion": "We'll discuss it later."}
{"prompt": "He does. Could we have a table close to him?", "completion": "And as far away from Major Strasser as possible."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?", "completion": "I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa."}
{"prompt": "But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?", "completion": "Yes, I would."}
{"prompt": "No, Victor, no.", "completion": "No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you."}
{"prompt": "We are only interested in two visas, Signor.", "completion": "Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty."}
{"prompt": "Goodnight.", "completion": "Goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Goodnight.", "completion": "Goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Be careful.", "completion": "I will, don't worry."}
{"prompt": "We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?", "completion": "I must find out what Berger knows."}
{"prompt": "This time they really mean to stop me.", "completion": "Victor, I'm afraid for you."}
{"prompt": "You are very kind.", "completion": "Won't you join us?"}
{"prompt": "Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.", "completion": "If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.", "completion": "You're saying this only to make me go."}
{"prompt": "I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.", "completion": "I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --"}
{"prompt": "Well then, perhaps you also ---", "completion": "-- This is Mr. Laszlo."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Rick.", "completion": "Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?"}
{"prompt": "-- Is what?", "completion": "Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man."}
{"prompt": "Rick? Who's he?", "completion": "Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "He came from Paris with Rick."}
{"prompt": "Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.", "completion": "Sam?"}
{"prompt": "I understand.", "completion": "Here it is."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?"}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.", "completion": "I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me."}
{"prompt": "Everything in order?", "completion": "All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave."}
{"prompt": "No. It's all arranged.", "completion": "Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank."}
{"prompt": "But we made a deal.", "completion": "Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?"}
{"prompt": "I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.", "completion": "Keep it. You'll need it in America."}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.", "completion": "Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do."}
{"prompt": "You love her that much?", "completion": "Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being."}
{"prompt": "You seem to know all about my destiny.", "completion": "I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I get the point.", "completion": "I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed."}
{"prompt": "What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.", "completion": "You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil."}
{"prompt": "Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?", "completion": "We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die."}
{"prompt": "Had a close one, eh?", "completion": "Yes, rather."}
{"prompt": "Well, this might come in handy.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "I said, ask your wife.", "completion": "My wife?"}
{"prompt": "There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.", "completion": "I beg your pardon?"}
{"prompt": "My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.", "completion": "There must be some reason why you won't let me have them."}
{"prompt": "I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.", "completion": "I'll raise it to two hundred thousand."}
{"prompt": "Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.", "completion": "Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?"}
{"prompt": "What of it?", "completion": "Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.", "completion": "My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work."}
{"prompt": "Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.", "completion": "My office."}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?", "completion": "Go ahead."}
{"prompt": "Good evening. You see, here we are again.", "completion": "I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days."}
{"prompt": "Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.", "completion": "Good evening."}
{"prompt": "Any time.", "completion": "Good morning."}
{"prompt": "Not at all.", "completion": "We'll come again."}
{"prompt": "We all try. You succeed.", "completion": "I hope we didn't overstay our welcome."}
{"prompt": "Your work.", "completion": "Thank you. I try."}
{"prompt": "And I congratulate you.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.", "completion": "Won't you join us for a drink?"}
{"prompt": "How do you do?", "completion": "One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca."}
{"prompt": "Are you quite finished with us?", "completion": "How do you do?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?", "completion": "I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I believe you have a message for him?"}
{"prompt": "-- Thank you.", "completion": "By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte."}
{"prompt": "I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.", "completion": "Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --"}
{"prompt": "Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.", "completion": "And the honor of having served the Third Reich."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur."}
{"prompt": "May we proceed with the business?", "completion": "With pleasure. Won't you sit down?"}
{"prompt": "I slept very well.", "completion": "That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca."}
{"prompt": "Goodnight.", "completion": "I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?"}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.", "completion": "We'll be there."}
{"prompt": "Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.", "completion": "So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself."}
{"prompt": "This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.", "completion": "Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle."}
{"prompt": "No. Two champagne cocktails, please.", "completion": "Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!"}
{"prompt": "Very well.", "completion": "My bill."}
{"prompt": "No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.", "completion": "Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word."}
{"prompt": "I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.", "completion": "No, Captain, please."}
{"prompt": "Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.", "completion": "Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?"}
{"prompt": "I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.", "completion": "Yes. What is it you want?"}
{"prompt": "Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "For the time being.", "completion": "Good day."}
{"prompt": "Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.", "completion": "You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault."}
{"prompt": "If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more \"persuasive methods\" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.", "completion": "And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast."}
{"prompt": "Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.", "completion": "You will give us the names?"}
{"prompt": "You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.", "completion": "Even in Berlin."}
{"prompt": "Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.", "completion": "And that is?"}
{"prompt": "Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?", "completion": "Is that all you wish to tell us?"}
{"prompt": "Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.", "completion": "Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical."}
{"prompt": "Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.", "completion": "Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?"}
{"prompt": "I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.", "completion": "This is hardly the time or the place."}
{"prompt": "You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!", "completion": "I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil."}
{"prompt": "Ask Monsieur Rick.", "completion": "I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian."}
{"prompt": "Victor Laszlo is on that plane.", "completion": "Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?"}
{"prompt": "Find one.", "completion": "What is the meaning of that phone call?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.", "completion": "But I have no excuse to close it."}
{"prompt": "You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.", "completion": "But everybody's having such a good time."}
{"prompt": "Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.", "completion": "I see what you mean."}
{"prompt": "We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.", "completion": "A leader, like Laszlo?"}
{"prompt": "I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.", "completion": "And if it should change?"}
{"prompt": "My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.", "completion": "Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?"}
{"prompt": "It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.", "completion": "You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe."}
{"prompt": "But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they \"blundered\" into Berlin in 1918.", "completion": "As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day."}
{"prompt": "If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.", "completion": "You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American."}
{"prompt": "Mademoiselle.", "completion": "I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps.", "completion": "Mademoiselle."}
{"prompt": "I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.", "completion": "You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick."}
{"prompt": "You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.", "completion": "Of course, one must admit he has great courage."}
{"prompt": "How about New York?", "completion": "Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too."}
{"prompt": "Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.", "completion": "Ho, diplomatist!"}
{"prompt": "You repeat \"Third Reich\" as though you expected there to be others.", "completion": "Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes."}
{"prompt": "Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.", "completion": "How do you do, Mr. Rick?"}
{"prompt": "Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.", "completion": "I expected no less, Captain."}
{"prompt": "May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.", "completion": "Champagne and a tin of caviar."}
{"prompt": "Good evening, gentlemen.", "completion": "Good evening, Captain."}
{"prompt": "Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.", "completion": "I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself."}
{"prompt": "By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?", "completion": "Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects."}
{"prompt": "Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.", "completion": "What else, my dear Major?"}
{"prompt": "Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.", "completion": "You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major."}
{"prompt": "Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.", "completion": "Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here."}
{"prompt": "Uh huh.", "completion": "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."}
{"prompt": "And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.", "completion": "Our expenses?"}
{"prompt": "It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.", "completion": "My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs."}
{"prompt": "Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.", "completion": "I think perhaps you're right."}
{"prompt": "As soon as the plane goes, Louis.", "completion": "Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."}
{"prompt": "Anyway, thanks for helping me out.", "completion": "I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course."}
{"prompt": "Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.", "completion": "What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying."}
{"prompt": "And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.", "completion": "Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist."}
{"prompt": "If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.", "completion": "You think of everything, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.", "completion": "That is my least vulnerable spot."}
{"prompt": "I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.", "completion": "Call off your watch-dogs you said."}
{"prompt": "Put that gun down.", "completion": "I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?"}
{"prompt": "Have you taken leave of your senses?", "completion": "I have. Sit down over there."}
{"prompt": "Serves me right for not being musical.", "completion": "-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet."}
{"prompt": "Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?", "completion": "Sam's piano."}
{"prompt": "Is everything ready?", "completion": "I have the letters right here."}
{"prompt": "You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.", "completion": "Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette."}
{"prompt": "I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.", "completion": "Oh, he won't be followed here."}
{"prompt": "You're late.", "completion": "I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time."}
{"prompt": "Oh, thanks.", "completion": "Go ahead, Ricky."}
{"prompt": "I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.", "completion": "Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I."}
{"prompt": "Well, she isn't just any woman.", "completion": "I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?"}
{"prompt": "I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.", "completion": "There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman."}
{"prompt": "It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.", "completion": "Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves."}
{"prompt": "You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?", "completion": "Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?"}
{"prompt": "What friend?", "completion": "Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate."}
{"prompt": "Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.", "completion": "You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane."}
{"prompt": "Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.", "completion": "Well, they're all excellent reasons."}
{"prompt": "Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --", "completion": "-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?"}
{"prompt": "I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!", "completion": "But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now."}
{"prompt": "Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!", "completion": "How can you close me up? On what grounds?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you interfere with my little romances?", "completion": "Put it down as a gesture to love."}
{"prompt": "As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.", "completion": "Yeah? Why?"}
{"prompt": "So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.", "completion": "Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick."}
{"prompt": "Well, it looks like you're a little late.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?", "completion": "Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed."}
{"prompt": "That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.", "completion": "Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?"}
{"prompt": "Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.", "completion": "Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman."}
{"prompt": "-- Thanks. I will.", "completion": "Oh, it's my party."}
{"prompt": "-- Hello, Ilsa.", "completion": "Oh, no, Rick never --"}
{"prompt": "I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.", "completion": "Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --"}
{"prompt": "And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.", "completion": "That makes Rick a citizen of the world."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me.", "completion": "Oh, how do you do?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.", "completion": "Yeah, you were saying?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.", "completion": "I have my orders."}
{"prompt": "And got well paid for it on both occasions.", "completion": "The winning side would have paid you much better."}
{"prompt": "Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.", "completion": "Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side."}
{"prompt": "It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.", "completion": "Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?"}
{"prompt": "I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.", "completion": "Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are."}
{"prompt": "He is traveling with a lady.", "completion": "He'll take one."}
{"prompt": "Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.", "completion": "Why two?"}
{"prompt": "Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Is that a serious offer?", "completion": "I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back."}
{"prompt": "This is the end of the chase.", "completion": "Twenty thousand francs says it isn't."}
{"prompt": "Oh, but I just told you. --", "completion": "-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe."}
{"prompt": "Manages what?", "completion": "His escape."}
{"prompt": "It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.", "completion": "It'll be interesting to see how he manages."}
{"prompt": "Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.", "completion": "Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world."}
{"prompt": "Victor Laszlo.", "completion": "Victor Laszlo?"}
{"prompt": "That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.", "completion": "Yeah? What's his name?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.", "completion": "I thought it was because we let you win at roulette."}
{"prompt": "How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.", "completion": "Yeah? Have a brandy?"}
{"prompt": "I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.", "completion": "Perhaps not."}
{"prompt": "You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.", "completion": "Our entertainment is enough."}
{"prompt": "I stick my neck out for nobody.", "completion": "A wise foreign policy."}
{"prompt": "This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.", "completion": "If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape."}
{"prompt": "Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.", "completion": "What, again?"}
{"prompt": "I was misinformed.", "completion": "Huh!"}
{"prompt": "My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.", "completion": "Waters? What waters? We're in the desert."}
{"prompt": "It was a combination of all three.", "completion": "And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?"}
{"prompt": "Why? What's in Lisbon?", "completion": "The clipper to America."}
{"prompt": "When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.", "completion": "The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?"}
{"prompt": "How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.", "completion": "You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?"}
{"prompt": "Take your hands off me!", "completion": "Hello, Louis."}
{"prompt": "-- Sacha, call a cab.", "completion": "Come on, we're going to get your coat."}
{"prompt": "Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.", "completion": "Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --"}
{"prompt": "Give me another.", "completion": "Sacha, she's had enough."}
{"prompt": "Will I see you tonight?", "completion": "I never make plans that far ahead."}
{"prompt": "Where were you last night?", "completion": "That's so long ago, I don't remember."}
{"prompt": "Get me the Radio Tower!", "completion": "Put it down!"}
{"prompt": "Hello?", "completion": "Put that phone down!"}
{"prompt": "I would advise you not to interfere.", "completion": "I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you."}
{"prompt": "You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.", "completion": "Good evening, Mr. Blaine."}
{"prompt": "Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.", "completion": "Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar."}
{"prompt": "My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.", "completion": "In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Are my eyes really brown?", "completion": "You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us."}
{"prompt": "Aha. Who do you think will win the war?", "completion": "I haven't the slightest idea."}
{"prompt": "It's not particularly my beloved Paris.", "completion": "Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade."}
{"prompt": "There seems to be no secret about that.", "completion": "Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?"}
{"prompt": "I'm a drunkard.", "completion": "I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation."}
{"prompt": "Make it official, if you like.", "completion": "What is your nationality?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be a fool. You can't get away.", "completion": "Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!"}
{"prompt": "Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.", "completion": "Rick! Rick, help me!"}
{"prompt": "Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.", "completion": "I don't want them here overnight."}
{"prompt": "One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.", "completion": "For how long?"}
{"prompt": "Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?", "completion": "Myself. I found myself much more reasonable."}
{"prompt": "I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.", "completion": "Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca."}
{"prompt": "For a price, Ugarte, for a price.", "completion": "But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?"}
{"prompt": "If I gave you any thought, I probably would.", "completion": "But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.", "completion": "Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?"}
{"prompt": "May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?", "completion": "They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'."}
{"prompt": "Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --", "completion": "-- You thought what?"}
{"prompt": "Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.", "completion": "Well, what makes you think I haven't?"}
{"prompt": "Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.", "completion": "Hello Ugarte."}
{"prompt": "Where is she? Have you seen her?", "completion": "No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her."}
{"prompt": "And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.", "completion": "The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head."}
{"prompt": "This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?", "completion": "You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid."}
{"prompt": "If she can stand it, I can. Play it!", "completion": "Yes, boss."}
{"prompt": "You played it for her and you can play it for me.", "completion": "Well, I don't think I can remember it."}
{"prompt": "Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.", "completion": "No, I don't."}
{"prompt": "What's that you're playing?", "completion": "Just a little something of my own."}
{"prompt": "Uh, my watch stopped.", "completion": "I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, boss?", "completion": "Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?"}
{"prompt": "No, sir. I'm staying right here.", "completion": "They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?"}
{"prompt": "We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.", "completion": "Shut up and go home, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.", "completion": "She's coming back. I know she's coming back."}

{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived."}
{"prompt": "Maybe now's when you tell me about it.", "completion": "The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am."}

{"prompt": "Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.", "completion": "What's that, written on the sail?"}

{"prompt": "Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.", "completion": "Merry Christmas eve."}
{"prompt": "Chuck.", "completion": "What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?"}
{"prompt": "Got to follow the paper path here.", "completion": "Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?"}
{"prompt": "Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?", "completion": "I thought I did."}
{"prompt": "How was Russia?", "completion": "Cold."}
{"prompt": "My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.", "completion": "Let's take a look."}

{"prompt": "Anything else?", "completion": "There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney."}
{"prompt": "When's the next Jumbo?", "completion": "The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "And how was your Christmas?", "completion": "Terrific.  Yours?"}
{"prompt": "Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.", "completion": "I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg."}
{"prompt": "Not to mention on me.", "completion": "Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here."}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes he did.", "completion": "You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?"}
{"prompt": "I most definitely say I am.", "completion": "Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you."}
{"prompt": "But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.", "completion": "If you say you are."}
{"prompt": "I am one lucky guy.", "completion": "Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out."}
{"prompt": "Which I didn't have.", "completion": "And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy."}
{"prompt": "All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.", "completion": "Protein digestion is very costly in water usage."}
{"prompt": "Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?", "completion": "Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above."}
{"prompt": "My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?", "completion": "Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely."}
{"prompt": "You're Chuck Noland.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago."}

{"prompt": "Just don't count 'em before they hatch.", "completion": "Need some help?"}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business."}
{"prompt": "Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.", "completion": "True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know."}
{"prompt": "So did I.", "completion": "But chickens?"}
{"prompt": "Let's eat.", "completion": "Thought you were going to bring her."}
{"prompt": "The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.", "completion": "Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen."}
{"prompt": "This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.", "completion": "What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear."}

{"prompt": "Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?", "completion": "That new roof, that's your doing."}
{"prompt": "It seemed like she had such a good time last time.", "completion": "It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me."}
{"prompt": "What happened to your pants?", "completion": "Mom, meet Jango."}
{"prompt": "Can you find her?", "completion": "You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it."}
{"prompt": "Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.", "completion": "Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.", "completion": "What about the sender?"}

{"prompt": "Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.", "completion": "You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do."}
{"prompt": "Deep, real deep.", "completion": "What, then?"}
{"prompt": "Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.", "completion": "Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it."}

You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice."}
{"prompt": "Forget it.", "completion": "You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go."}

Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...", "completion": "No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on."}

{"prompt": "Only if you can afford it.", "completion": "Try to think of nothing, Dorothy."}
{"prompt": "What's she so emotional about?", "completion": "I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?"}
{"prompt": "I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.", "completion": "I doubt it. She's just an..."}
{"prompt": "Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Better than I can!", "completion": "Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes."}
{"prompt": "You cook very well!", "completion": "And that I can drive a truck!"}
{"prompt": "What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?", "completion": "Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little."}
{"prompt": "Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.", "completion": "Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway."}
{"prompt": "I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Homer.", "completion": "I mean your parents."}
{"prompt": "But you've studied with the old man for *years*!", "completion": "I'm *not* a doctor!"}
{"prompt": "*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.", "completion": "I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!"}
{"prompt": "He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!", "completion": "He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether."}
{"prompt": "He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!", "completion": "It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to."}
{"prompt": "Shouldn't we tell Homer?", "completion": "If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us."}
{"prompt": "Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?", "completion": "They'll believe it because they want to believe it."}
{"prompt": "What are you going to tell the little ones?", "completion": "I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted."}
{"prompt": "What'd she die of?", "completion": "She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*..."}
{"prompt": "Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.", "completion": "Good night, Daddy."}
{"prompt": "How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?", "completion": "Daddy, *please*..."}
{"prompt": "It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.", "completion": "Good night, Daddy."}
{"prompt": "He mentions Homer, too, you know.", "completion": "Wally said to say, \"Hello.\""}
{"prompt": "I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!", "completion": "Daddy, it's a letter to *me*."}
{"prompt": "No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.", "completion": "It's time somebody ate *them*."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.", "completion": "No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry."}
{"prompt": "Sure. Thanks.", "completion": "I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter..."}
{"prompt": "She knows how to take care of herself.", "completion": "This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot."}
{"prompt": "You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!", "completion": "Do you think she'll be all right?"}
{"prompt": "Please don't...", "completion": "And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you..."}
{"prompt": "Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.", "completion": "\"...did.\" Well, okay."}
{"prompt": "No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.", "completion": "I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to *do*?", "completion": "Please don't make me say it again."}
{"prompt": "He's *paralyzed*!", "completion": "He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I."}
{"prompt": "For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!", "completion": "I know, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Stop it! Just cut it out!", "completion": "You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!"}
{"prompt": "If you're trying to be funny, Homer...", "completion": "I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all..."}
{"prompt": "Please don't move, don't go anywhere.", "completion": "*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!"}
{"prompt": "I know.  Is *that* nothing.", "completion": "No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want..."}
{"prompt": "Isn't that like waiting and seeing?", "completion": "No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too."}
{"prompt": "Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?", "completion": "We've got to keep her away from that bastard!"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Rose *knows*?", "completion": "He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!"}
{"prompt": "Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.", "completion": "You don't understand! It's her father..."}
{"prompt": "Well, we have to help her!", "completion": "She won't go to St. Cloud's!"}
{"prompt": "We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...", "completion": "I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere..."}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay--I know you do, too.", "completion": "It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Fine. That's all there is to it then.", "completion": "No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do."}
{"prompt": "So we should \"wait and see.\" For how long?", "completion": "I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him."}
{"prompt": "I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.", "completion": "Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?"}
{"prompt": "We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.", "completion": "Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself."}
{"prompt": "It will be okay.", "completion": "*What* will be okay?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?"}
{"prompt": "Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.", "completion": "I *know* this was right."}
{"prompt": "Not with the right girl you wouldn't.", "completion": "Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?"}
{"prompt": "You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.", "completion": "That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie."}
{"prompt": "The *speaker*. For the movie sound.", "completion": "How could you not *care* about the movie?"}
{"prompt": "Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.", "completion": "Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?"}
{"prompt": "Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.", "completion": "Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?"}
{"prompt": "I never *asked* for any responsibility.", "completion": "Just a little privacy."}
{"prompt": "I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.", "completion": "But you had so much *responsibility*."}
{"prompt": "I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.", "completion": "You don't miss it?"}
{"prompt": "It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.", "completion": "At least you were never lonely."}
{"prompt": "Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.", "completion": "What are you so crazy about the movies for?"}
{"prompt": "You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!", "completion": "The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?"}
{"prompt": "Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about \"King Kong\"?! Is that medically possible?", "completion": "You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this."}
{"prompt": "Oh, sure!", "completion": "What's the *medical* explanation?"}
{"prompt": "And what did she die of, exactly?", "completion": "She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart."}
{"prompt": "First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...", "completion": "She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?"}
{"prompt": "But you looked as if you liked it.", "completion": "I *did* like it. All I said was, \"It's not 'King Kong'.\""}
{"prompt": "You've seen only one movie? Which one?", "completion": "\"King Kong\". It's really good."}
{"prompt": "When they watched at all. Do you like movies?", "completion": "Yes! I've only seen one, though."}
{"prompt": "Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.", "completion": "People watched the movies in their cars?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.", "completion": "A movie *outside*?"}
{"prompt": "Okay...", "completion": "I better go."}
{"prompt": "When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.", "completion": "You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then."}
{"prompt": "I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.", "completion": "Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?"}
{"prompt": "Sure... I'll see you around.", "completion": "So. Not bored yet?"}
{"prompt": "It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.", "completion": "I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything."}
{"prompt": "I understand.", "completion": "I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay."}
{"prompt": "Oh...", "completion": "I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!"}
{"prompt": "Where's Mandalay?", "completion": "Burma!"}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!"}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "I've never seen the ocean, either."}
{"prompt": "No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.", "completion": "I've never seen a lobster."}
{"prompt": "Two.", "completion": "Is your family in the apple business, too?"}
{"prompt": "Candy. Candy Kendall.", "completion": "How many months are you?"}
{"prompt": "No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...", "completion": "So, Mrs..."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?"}
{"prompt": "I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...", "completion": "I can't go nowhere."}
{"prompt": "You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.", "completion": "Yes, I *have*!"}
{"prompt": "I don't need no more clothes, thank you.", "completion": "Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this."}
{"prompt": "Hi...", "completion": "I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me."}
{"prompt": "Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...", "completion": "Hi..."}
{"prompt": "*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?", "completion": "How is that Wally doing?"}
{"prompt": "He *loved* it!  Didn't you?", "completion": "He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches."}
{"prompt": "I know what you've been doing.", "completion": "You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!"}
{"prompt": "I love you, too. See you tomorrow.", "completion": "I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson."}
{"prompt": "Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!", "completion": "I love you, Wally."}
{"prompt": "Well, they aren't.", "completion": "There! You said it was boring."}
{"prompt": "I never said they were boring.", "completion": "You said, \"Apples aren't exactly flying.\""}
{"prompt": "No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.", "completion": "Wally thinks apples are boring."}
{"prompt": "I'm okay--I can walk.", "completion": "I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold."}
{"prompt": "So many children. Are they all orphans?", "completion": "Well, this *is* an orphanage."}
{"prompt": "You mean somebody asked?", "completion": "Only the right people can have you, Curly."}
{"prompt": "Nobody's asked for me, have they?", "completion": "Nobody special enough, Curly."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!", "completion": "That's true."}
{"prompt": "Nobody ever wants me!", "completion": "You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you."}
{"prompt": "I thought they might take me.", "completion": "They wanted a girl."}
{"prompt": "Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.", "completion": "Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?"}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!", "completion": "I just wanted to ask you..."}
{"prompt": "Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!", "completion": "He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too."}
{"prompt": "So here is my candidate. What do you think?", "completion": "But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*..."}
{"prompt": "You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.", "completion": "Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law."}
{"prompt": "Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?", "completion": "\"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939.\""}

I think it's a crochet hook.", "completion": "I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!"}
{"prompt": "How old are you, dear? Thirteen?", "completion": "That's a heavy sedation."}
{"prompt": "Someone not from Maine.", "completion": "Her temperature is a hundred and four."}
{"prompt": "No. She was an immigrant.", "completion": "What's an immigrant?"}
{"prompt": "She looks after other people's children.", "completion": "Did you grow up around here?"}
{"prompt": "She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.", "completion": "What's a nanny do?"}
{"prompt": "Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.", "completion": "Did you know your mother better?"}

{"prompt": "Is that soon?", "completion": "Don't get too excited, Fuzzy."}
{"prompt": "His father's dead, right?", "completion": "Uh... it's the end of October."}
{"prompt": "That's why Kong loves her!", "completion": "\"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it.\""}
{"prompt": "Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?", "completion": "Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right."}
{"prompt": "No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.", "completion": "I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone."}
{"prompt": "It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.", "completion": "Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me."}
{"prompt": "Did you bite it?", "completion": "I don't remember."}
{"prompt": "Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.", "completion": "I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one."}
{"prompt": "Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.", "completion": "You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too."}
{"prompt": "The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.", "completion": "Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?"}
{"prompt": "It's almost like flying.", "completion": "What about the trees?"}
{"prompt": "Migrants?", "completion": "Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I would love that, Wally.", "completion": "They're migrants."}
{"prompt": "Actually, I volunteered.", "completion": "Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring."}
{"prompt": "I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.", "completion": "What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!"}
{"prompt": "*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.", "completion": "At what altitude?"}
{"prompt": "It's all very normal.", "completion": "\"Burma run\" because you fly over Burma..."}

{"prompt": "No, I'm not. I need a job.", "completion": "The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring."}
{"prompt": "I think I'd probably like the apple business.", "completion": "You're a little overqualified, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Where are you going?", "completion": "We're heading back to Cape Kenneth."}
{"prompt": "I wonder if you might give me a ride.", "completion": "Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?"}
{"prompt": "Has anyone offered you anything to eat?", "completion": "Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything."}

{"prompt": "There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.", "completion": "That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me."}
{"prompt": "Where'd she get you?", "completion": "She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. Then you can be of use.", "completion": "If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her."}

{"prompt": "Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.", "completion": "You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!"}
{"prompt": "I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.", "completion": "You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!", "completion": "Is it true?"}
{"prompt": "This is easy--I'm not hurrying.", "completion": "You still doin' it too fast!"}
{"prompt": "Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!", "completion": "Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry."}
{"prompt": "Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...", "completion": "What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms."}
{"prompt": "Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...", "completion": "Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong."}
{"prompt": "That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?", "completion": "I guess so..."}
{"prompt": "Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.", "completion": "Okay..."}
{"prompt": "It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "So. What should I do now?", "completion": "Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there."}
{"prompt": "I am not a doctor.", "completion": "You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!"}
{"prompt": "I don't need this--I know all about my condition.", "completion": "It's your heart--you ought to take it with you."}
{"prompt": "You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...", "completion": "I don't need your gratitude."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!"}
{"prompt": "I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.", "completion": "In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways."}
{"prompt": "Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?", "completion": "Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do."}
{"prompt": "Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.", "completion": "Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!"}
{"prompt": "It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.", "completion": "I'm happy I amuse you."}
{"prompt": "How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?", "completion": "How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?"}
{"prompt": "I thought it was my turn.", "completion": "It is. I'll get this. You go ahead."}

{"prompt": "I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.", "completion": "But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?"}
{"prompt": "Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.", "completion": "I haven't read that."}

{"prompt": "I don't know it.", "completion": "If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C."}
{"prompt": "Obviously.", "completion": "Christ, it's oil of tansy!"}
{"prompt": "Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!", "completion": "It's obviously an aborticide."}
{"prompt": "No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!", "completion": "It looks like scurvy."}
{"prompt": "What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.", "completion": "There was no visible wound?"}
{"prompt": "You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?", "completion": "One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me."}
{"prompt": "I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.", "completion": "All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them."}
{"prompt": "First pregnancy?", "completion": "Yes, for both."}

{"prompt": "Uh... sure.", "completion": "Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over."}
{"prompt": "I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.", "completion": "I don't know.  Just promise me one thing."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.", "completion": "There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!", "completion": "What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer."}
{"prompt": "\"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch.\"", "completion": "Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on."}
{"prompt": "\"One: Please don't smoke in bed.\"", "completion": "We heard that one already, Homer."}
{"prompt": "How long's this been going on, Muddy?", "completion": "Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it."}
{"prompt": "It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!", "completion": "Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you."}
{"prompt": "That's *it*?", "completion": "That's it."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!", "completion": "Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen..."}
{"prompt": "What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.", "completion": "You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*."}

{"prompt": "Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.", "completion": "But you don't look very happy."}
{"prompt": "Not yet. What do you know about it?", "completion": "I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?"}
{"prompt": "I don't like watching anyone be sick.", "completion": "You're not yet three months, are you?"}
{"prompt": "You okay, Rose?", "completion": "I guess you must like watchin' me be sick..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?", "completion": "Almost."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.", "completion": "Give men that. I know how to do it."}
{"prompt": "No trouble.", "completion": "I'm not in trouble."}
{"prompt": "I can't read. Nobody taught me.", "completion": "You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope."}
{"prompt": "Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.", "completion": "Do you like to read?"}
{"prompt": "There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.", "completion": "So what?"}
{"prompt": "It's just my heart.", "completion": "What you got a picture of your heart for?"}
{"prompt": "Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...", "completion": "Rose Rose?"}
{"prompt": "It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.", "completion": "You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!"}
{"prompt": "That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.", "completion": "Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!"}
{"prompt": "I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.", "completion": "You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight."}
{"prompt": "Shit. We don't know what he is.", "completion": "Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter."}
{"prompt": "Who cares?", "completion": "Now, now. He's a good boy."}
{"prompt": "I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!", "completion": "Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested."}
{"prompt": "You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?", "completion": "Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!"}
{"prompt": "I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.", "completion": "Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!"}
{"prompt": "Do you know him?", "completion": "*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!"}
{"prompt": "When will he be home, Major?", "completion": "Four weeks or so, right around Halloween."}
{"prompt": "It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.", "completion": "No autonomic effects... that's correct."}
{"prompt": "Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...", "completion": "Then it's malaria?"}
{"prompt": "When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.", "completion": "Why was he missing for twenty days?"}
{"prompt": "They're *outrageous*, them rules!", "completion": "Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?"}
{"prompt": "They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!", "completion": "Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider."}
{"prompt": "What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?", "completion": "You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that."}
{"prompt": "Don't this place look like home?", "completion": "It look nicer then home!"}
{"prompt": "You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!", "completion": "We see you next harvest."}
{"prompt": "Mind your own business, Peaches.", "completion": "Sorry, Homer..."}
{"prompt": "They told Muddy his feet was too flat!", "completion": "Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?"}
{"prompt": "That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?", "completion": "They told me I was too old to serve."}
{"prompt": "That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?", "completion": "That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right."}
{"prompt": "She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?", "completion": "*You* taught her, I suppose..."}
{"prompt": "I told him that you all is sick.", "completion": "Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today."}
{"prompt": "It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.", "completion": "Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy."}
{"prompt": "Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.", "completion": "Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time."}
{"prompt": "*What* view?", "completion": "Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about."}
{"prompt": "Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.", "completion": "What view?"}
{"prompt": "You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.", "completion": "That's right, Homer. This ain't your business."}
{"prompt": "You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!", "completion": "I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go."}
{"prompt": "Where do you think you're going?", "completion": "You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please..."}
{"prompt": "Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.", "completion": "You just stay out of trouble, Homer!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!", "completion": "You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?"}
{"prompt": "We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!", "completion": "Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in."}
{"prompt": "That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.", "completion": "That's right--that sounds like trouble to me."}
{"prompt": "You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...", "completion": "What's lucky about that?"}
{"prompt": "He ain't never been outta Maine!", "completion": "Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night."}
{"prompt": "She took off on the bicycle, man.", "completion": "You ever see a palm tree, Homer?"}
{"prompt": "Rose Rose has runned away!", "completion": "She took off in the night!"}
{"prompt": "The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...", "completion": "Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed."}
{"prompt": "She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.", "completion": "You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man."}
{"prompt": "You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.", "completion": "That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!"}
{"prompt": "Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.", "completion": "Oh. Well, thanks for the drink."}
{"prompt": "Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.", "completion": "No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank."}
{"prompt": "So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say \"no\" without ever using the word.", "completion": "Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery."}
{"prompt": "Can --", "completion": "On me. For the seat. Cheers."}
{"prompt": "Silicon Valley?", "completion": "That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here."}
{"prompt": "So, what do you do?", "completion": "It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there."}
{"prompt": "My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.", "completion": "Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn."}
{"prompt": "Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?", "completion": "Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.", "completion": "Tough day?"}
{"prompt": "But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.", "completion": "I wasn't sure if you'd make it."}
{"prompt": "Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.", "completion": "Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --"}
{"prompt": "Ten percent. Of how much?", "completion": "Two million."}
{"prompt": "Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.", "completion": "The standard ten."}
{"prompt": "You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.", "completion": "No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut."}
{"prompt": "You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.", "completion": "Let's just slow down for a second..."}
{"prompt": "There'll be red flags.", "completion": "What's this?"}
{"prompt": "This has to happen fast.", "completion": "I know. It won't go unnoticed."}
{"prompt": "We had to finalize the deal.", "completion": "Everything looks in order."}
{"prompt": "And you have this letter of intent?", "completion": "Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little."}
{"prompt": "Sort of like a letter of intent.", "completion": "Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore."}
{"prompt": "Big.Com. That Internet thing.", "completion": "Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan."}
{"prompt": "I don't follow.", "completion": "Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?"}
{"prompt": "Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.", "completion": "We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22"}
{"prompt": "That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.", "completion": "They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course."}
{"prompt": "Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --", "completion": "A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part."}
{"prompt": "Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.", "completion": "Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan."}
{"prompt": "What do you do over at your bank, Grant?", "completion": "What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance."}
{"prompt": "Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.", "completion": "I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that."}
{"prompt": "It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.", "completion": "It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?", "completion": "I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?"}
{"prompt": "Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.", "completion": "Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted."}
{"prompt": "So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...", "completion": "Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?"}
{"prompt": "Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.", "completion": "Guess so."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?", "completion": "It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark."}
{"prompt": "Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?", "completion": "Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government."}
{"prompt": "Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?", "completion": "Today? Started off great..."}
{"prompt": "After you cut her loose.", "completion": "She walked."}
{"prompt": "Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!", "completion": "We were back on."}
{"prompt": "BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.", "completion": "It's not true."}
{"prompt": "So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...", "completion": "I was doing it for them."}
{"prompt": "Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?", "completion": "You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden."}
{"prompt": "She had you tempting fate.", "completion": "My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million."}
{"prompt": "Like what?", "completion": "Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all."}
{"prompt": "You're a superstitious fucker.", "completion": "Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad."}
{"prompt": "Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?", "completion": "Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck."}
{"prompt": "Nice.", "completion": "We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank."}
{"prompt": "He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.", "completion": "Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold."}
{"prompt": "But there were other factors.", "completion": "Factors that weren't clear to me until now."}
{"prompt": "I can see why you liked her.", "completion": "That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark."}
{"prompt": "So how'd you get caught?", "completion": "Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer."}
{"prompt": "So you want to know how to play the Big Con.", "completion": "In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con."}
{"prompt": "You never know when you can use a crooked cop.", "completion": "Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby."}
{"prompt": "And these cops? What do they get?", "completion": "Keeping the Fix happy."}
{"prompt": "Isn't it always?", "completion": "I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley."}
{"prompt": "We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.", "completion": "It's all about the money, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "That's not a bad place to start.", "completion": "Grifters..."}
{"prompt": "Your life flashing before your eyes?", "completion": "Just the last three weeks."}
{"prompt": "Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.", "completion": "Gee... What makes you say that?"}
{"prompt": "The Anti-Christ?", "completion": "No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers."}
{"prompt": "And I think it's because of this redhead...", "completion": "Know who I am, Jake?"}
{"prompt": "Ten is standard, sir.", "completion": "Fine. But only if we recover the cash."}
{"prompt": "We'll take care of it.", "completion": "And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?"}
{"prompt": "So we go to the bar.", "completion": "I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby."}
{"prompt": "Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?", "completion": "Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money."}
{"prompt": "Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.", "completion": "I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?"}
{"prompt": "The red hair... It's bad luck.", "completion": "It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake..."}
{"prompt": "This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.", "completion": "People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A."}
{"prompt": "Fuck that. We're going too.", "completion": "Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?"}
{"prompt": "Whoa. What?", "completion": "We're going to give him the money back?"}
{"prompt": "We sure Big Al threw him to us?", "completion": "Come on..."}
{"prompt": "No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --", "completion": "Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is."}
{"prompt": "What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.", "completion": "You're pissed we didn't get credit?"}
{"prompt": "Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.", "completion": "So what? We hide, right?"}
{"prompt": "Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.", "completion": "Mob?"}

{"prompt": "It can buy you a new and better you.", "completion": "I just don't know if this says, \"me\". What's the fabric?"}
{"prompt": "Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.", "completion": "I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?"}
{"prompt": "What? I can feel you looking at me.", "completion": "That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick."}
{"prompt": "I told you, use less powder.", "completion": "But you won't get that splatter effect."}
{"prompt": "Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.", "completion": "Shit."}
{"prompt": "Come on. Harder.", "completion": "I think I just broke my hand."}
{"prompt": "No thanks. I'm good.", "completion": "Come here!"}
{"prompt": "You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?", "completion": "Come here. Feel this."}
{"prompt": "I said take off your fucking shirt.", "completion": "Look at you, you skinny prick."}
{"prompt": "No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.", "completion": "Excuse me?"}
{"prompt": "Hey Skippy? Do I have the word \"chump\" tattooed on my forehead?", "completion": "Listen, Scooter --"}
{"prompt": "That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?", "completion": "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."}
{"prompt": "Stake you?", "completion": "I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done."}
{"prompt": "What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.", "completion": "I need you to stake me."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "I think two million."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em."}
{"prompt": "I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.", "completion": "We got caught. So you know it won't happen again."}
{"prompt": "Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.", "completion": "No. Just confidence."}
{"prompt": "Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...", "completion": "I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square."}
{"prompt": "Let me repeat -- Why not?", "completion": "Because you killed one of my crew."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Let me rephrase -- I won't do that."}
{"prompt": "Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.", "completion": "I can't do that."}
{"prompt": "You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...", "completion": "I apologize for the inconvenience."}
{"prompt": "Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.", "completion": "You can't cheat an honest man."}
{"prompt": "You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.", "completion": "I guess it lacks a certain style."}
{"prompt": "Minus one.", "completion": "Minus one."}
{"prompt": "Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?", "completion": "I have a good crew."}
{"prompt": "Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.", "completion": "Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there."}
{"prompt": "Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?", "completion": "Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy."}
{"prompt": "Something stupid.", "completion": "Good boy."}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't dream of it.", "completion": "I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.", "completion": "Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us."}
{"prompt": "Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.", "completion": "Ring it for him, Sobo."}
{"prompt": "Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.", "completion": "Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?"}
{"prompt": "That tip not work-out for you fellas?", "completion": "Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed."}
{"prompt": "All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.", "completion": "Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else."}
{"prompt": "Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.", "completion": "Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "What are you talking about? Ten's standard."}
{"prompt": "Very much so.", "completion": "Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?", "completion": "Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.", "completion": "Attractive girl."}
{"prompt": "Great. Thank you.", "completion": "What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.", "completion": "Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, I --", "completion": "Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice."}
{"prompt": "What about... The money?", "completion": "What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?"}
{"prompt": "What -- What do we do?", "completion": "Help me."}
{"prompt": "Oh Jesus!", "completion": "LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!"}
{"prompt": "I can't be here! You understand? I can't --", "completion": "Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!", "completion": "I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!"}
{"prompt": "No, I want my cut!", "completion": "I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened."}
{"prompt": "You tell them the \"Tale\".", "completion": "What do you want? An apology?"}
{"prompt": "What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?", "completion": "You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE."}
{"prompt": "You got my cell. Leave a message.", "completion": "It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it."}
{"prompt": "Sorry. I didn't know...", "completion": "Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you."}
{"prompt": "No, I want my cut!", "completion": "I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut."}
{"prompt": "What about the money?", "completion": "So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?"}
{"prompt": "What about...", "completion": "What about what?"}
{"prompt": "Everyone's working an angle, right?", "completion": "There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over."}
{"prompt": "You are such a raving pussy sometimes.", "completion": "Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either."}
{"prompt": "Jesus... Take it easy.", "completion": "No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time."}
{"prompt": "No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.", "completion": "You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too."}
{"prompt": "Did, uh... Did you kill him?", "completion": "I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way."}
{"prompt": "Lily... Jesus Christ...", "completion": "After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times."}
{"prompt": "Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to \"fuck some sense into me.\"", "completion": "Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him."}
{"prompt": "Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.", "completion": "He was looking out for you."}
{"prompt": "No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?", "completion": "Glenn talked you out of it."}
{"prompt": "We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.", "completion": "You guys got busted. This is a great neck."}
{"prompt": "He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.", "completion": "Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me."}
{"prompt": "Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.", "completion": "You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?"}
{"prompt": "Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.", "completion": "Sounds respectable."}
{"prompt": "WHAT?", "completion": "I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?"}
{"prompt": "Don't ruin this for me.", "completion": "How do you deal with --"}
{"prompt": "Intuition.", "completion": "You have really soft hands. Like a baby's."}
{"prompt": "No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.", "completion": "How do you know I will?"}
{"prompt": "Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.", "completion": "So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?"}
{"prompt": "I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.", "completion": "It's more than that."}
{"prompt": "Good quality porn has it's place in the world.", "completion": "Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?"}
{"prompt": "Not in that repressed anger sort of way.", "completion": "I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option."}
{"prompt": "Are you asking me if I have something to prove?", "completion": "Do you have something to prove?"}
{"prompt": "It's what I do. It's my job.", "completion": "Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?"}
{"prompt": "For what? A couple hundred bucks?", "completion": "I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush."}
{"prompt": "Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.", "completion": "Look at you... You want to go."}
{"prompt": "Did I miss something?", "completion": "We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it..."}
{"prompt": "You told me to change my hair!", "completion": "What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!"}
{"prompt": "Lighten up.", "completion": "But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house..."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.", "completion": "You just put a mother of a jinx on us."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.", "completion": "I gotta go get a haircut."}
{"prompt": "Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.", "completion": "He's gone."}
{"prompt": "Then show me how.", "completion": "Uh... Everything okay?"}
{"prompt": "You're just going to have to trust me.", "completion": "I don't trust anyone."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "And some new clothes."}
{"prompt": "It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?", "completion": "You need to get a haircut."}
{"prompt": "What the hell's his problem?", "completion": "Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "Mr. King, I think --", "completion": "Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here."}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.", "completion": "Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something."}
{"prompt": "What about Customs?", "completion": "I'll worry about Customs."}
{"prompt": "What do I have to do?", "completion": "Just play a part. A little acting."}
{"prompt": "No.  What's my cut?", "completion": "You get an equal cut."}
{"prompt": "Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.", "completion": "I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?"}
{"prompt": "Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.", "completion": "We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious."}
{"prompt": "Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?", "completion": "Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job."}
{"prompt": "You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.", "completion": "We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up."}
{"prompt": "Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?", "completion": "Says who?"}
{"prompt": "You interested in a little work?", "completion": "Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake."}
{"prompt": "We're not cops.", "completion": "That's not --"}
{"prompt": "Jake? Customs?", "completion": "What is this? You guys cops or something?"}
{"prompt": "And we got rid of the red head.", "completion": "And we got rid of the red head."}
{"prompt": "Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?", "completion": "Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light."}
{"prompt": "No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!", "completion": "Escorts!"}
{"prompt": "What do we do? We change the scam?", "completion": "There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk."}
{"prompt": "So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, \"You're fired! Your whole team's fired!\" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --", "completion": "But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!"}
{"prompt": "But if you wanna talk about bad luck...", "completion": "Where the hell is she?"}
{"prompt": "Him.", "completion": "You sure?"}
{"prompt": "What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.", "completion": "Michelle Strigo. Loan officer."}
{"prompt": "Is it all fugasi?", "completion": "No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like \"twenty-five to life\" pissed.", "completion": "I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?"}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.", "completion": "We're getting a little old for running."}
{"prompt": "We never had a problem with that before.", "completion": "Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...", "completion": "Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?"}
{"prompt": "Good point.", "completion": "It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?"}
{"prompt": "Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...", "completion": "Uh..."}
{"prompt": "Breasts.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.", "completion": "What do we need another Shill for?"}
{"prompt": "We're working for the King.", "completion": "Wait a second... Who's the mope?"}
{"prompt": "You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?", "completion": "Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg."}
{"prompt": "How do you know the King's going to let you walk?", "completion": "I'm getting a ride."}
{"prompt": "Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.", "completion": "Meet me at my place later."}
{"prompt": "He'll find us. We go talk to him.", "completion": "Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking..."}
{"prompt": "It's bad luck.", "completion": "Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere..."}
{"prompt": "Miles...", "completion": "Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young."}
{"prompt": "You better get over to Al's. Now.", "completion": "I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got."}
{"prompt": "You sure we're clear?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "My place.", "completion": "Stop waving that thing around."}
{"prompt": "Your mess.", "completion": "Then shut up."}
{"prompt": "Tick-tock...", "completion": "If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "This is embarrassing."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later..."}
{"prompt": "With identification.", "completion": "I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?"}
{"prompt": "That's no problem. We have those in stock.", "completion": "Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?"}
{"prompt": "What was it?", "completion": "A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.", "completion": "You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster."}
{"prompt": "Do you have a ticket?", "completion": "You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson."}
{"prompt": "You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...", "completion": "Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson."}
{"prompt": "HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!", "completion": "And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head..."}
{"prompt": "Eee Oott Auught!", "completion": "Sorry. What?"}
{"prompt": "No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Stand up."}
{"prompt": "That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.", "completion": "Egg Foo Young.  Stand up."}
{"prompt": "Keep it up.", "completion": "You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool."}
{"prompt": "That was fucking deep.", "completion": "What's up with you? Bladder infection?"}
{"prompt": "He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?", "completion": "Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit."}
{"prompt": "Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.", "completion": "You're a weasel."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.", "completion": "So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride."}
{"prompt": "Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.", "completion": "What'd he say?"}
{"prompt": "Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.", "completion": "Point, Lupus. Give us a point."}
{"prompt": "Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.", "completion": "My fucking heart bleeds."}
{"prompt": "What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.", "completion": "Of what? They're both crooks."}
{"prompt": "King ain't gonna like this.", "completion": "Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet."}
{"prompt": "You going to have the time?", "completion": "I'll find the time."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?", "completion": "When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al."}
{"prompt": "Still time.", "completion": "Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one."}
{"prompt": "I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.", "completion": "Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want."}
{"prompt": "It's not history.", "completion": "So what do you want?"}
{"prompt": "I can handle it.", "completion": "I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?"}
{"prompt": "The King.", "completion": "The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all."}
{"prompt": "Can't say.", "completion": "Then who's the Banker?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.", "completion": "I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, \"the kid's a prodigy.\" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?"}
{"prompt": "Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.", "completion": "A little bit of both."}
{"prompt": "Can I speak to you in confidence?", "completion": "Huh? Oh. She's alright."}
{"prompt": "In over your head?", "completion": "Pretty much."}
{"prompt": "Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?", "completion": "Pretty much."}

{"prompt": "Ten percent.", "completion": "You guys got sack, I'll give you that much."}
{"prompt": "I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.", "completion": "Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight."}
{"prompt": "He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.", "completion": "So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.", "completion": "Speak."}

{"prompt": "I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?", "completion": "Let's just say he burned me once."}
{"prompt": "Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.", "completion": "Did he buy it?"}
{"prompt": "I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.", "completion": "Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --"}

{"prompt": "You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.", "completion": "Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him."}
{"prompt": "Roger that.", "completion": "Special Agent?"}
{"prompt": "You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!", "completion": "He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig."}
{"prompt": "Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?", "completion": "Whaddya mean? We got dick."}
{"prompt": "This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.", "completion": "Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?"}
{"prompt": "That's it?", "completion": "Not everyone's on the take, Walter."}
{"prompt": "What do you get out of it?", "completion": "Peace of mind."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it."}
{"prompt": "I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.", "completion": "Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His \"Fix.\""}

{"prompt": "I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.", "completion": "It's just insurance."}
{"prompt": "Whoa, whoa... There he is.", "completion": "You trust this Moonan guy?"}

My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit."}
{"prompt": "What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.", "completion": "Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered."}

{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "You fucking little shit! You shopped me."}

{"prompt": "It's all relative.  I need the money too.", "completion": "Do you?"}
{"prompt": "It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.", "completion": "Well, life's not fair. We know that."}

{"prompt": "It won't.", "completion": "But if it does."}
{"prompt": "I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.", "completion": "What'll you do when it all goes wrong?"}
{"prompt": "You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.", "completion": "And I thought you were only after my body."}
{"prompt": "You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.", "completion": "You're serious."}
{"prompt": "Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.", "completion": "Robbery's not criminal?"}

Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy."}
{"prompt": "If I see you do it again, I'll report it.", "completion": "I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not going to report it.", "completion": "What are you, a cop?"}
{"prompt": "That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.", "completion": "I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong."}
{"prompt": "Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.", "completion": "What the fuck are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.", "completion": "Some other time."}
{"prompt": "I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.", "completion": "No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours."}
{"prompt": "You've done pretty well.", "completion": "Not bad. I have other interests, of course."}
{"prompt": "How long have you worked at the casino?", "completion": "Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months."}
{"prompt": "Nice car.", "completion": "She's my baby."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high."}
{"prompt": "Have you got transport?", "completion": "I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like."}
{"prompt": "Where do you live, Jack?", "completion": "Over the river."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.", "completion": "It was you, you shit."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid that's not so, sir.", "completion": "You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm."}
{"prompt": "You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.", "completion": "I put them on together."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.", "completion": "What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady."}
{"prompt": "Bruised.", "completion": "Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here..."}
{"prompt": "She was a real asset. But what could I do?", "completion": "How do you feel, Jack?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the information.", "completion": "A pleasure. Pity about Bella."}
{"prompt": "He's paying out in stacks of 25.", "completion": "I can see."}
{"prompt": "Does he win?", "completion": "He's a good customer."}
{"prompt": "All right, Mr Reynolds.", "completion": "Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella."}
{"prompt": "Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.", "completion": "Why don't you take a break, Jack."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "I just want the job."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "That hair will have to go."}
{"prompt": "We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.", "completion": "You can start Monday week."}
{"prompt": "This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.", "completion": "Very impressive."}
{"prompt": "She's not in the gaming business is she?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Girlfriend?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "How?", "completion": "First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?"}
{"prompt": "Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?", "completion": "We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished."}
{"prompt": "We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.", "completion": "This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does."}
{"prompt": "I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.", "completion": "Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden."}
{"prompt": "I don't gamble.", "completion": "Ever?"}
{"prompt": "What for?", "completion": "For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters."}
{"prompt": "I said good call.", "completion": "Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture."}
{"prompt": "Good call.", "completion": "You want me to check?"}
{"prompt": "What makes you so sure?", "completion": "It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right."}
{"prompt": "I make it six.", "completion": "Five."}
{"prompt": "How many aces are left?", "completion": "Five."}
{"prompt": "What happens if I want to sneeze?", "completion": "You won't. Not without permission."}
{"prompt": "Wipe your hands.", "completion": "Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched."}
{"prompt": "Haven't you forgotten something?", "completion": "I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "Where's the magnet?", "completion": "They've been tested."}
{"prompt": "You use two alternating, don't you?", "completion": "We do."}
{"prompt": "25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.", "completion": "Give me 365."}
{"prompt": "Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.", "completion": "Any exceptions?"}
{"prompt": "Why four? And not three or five?", "completion": "It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips."}
{"prompt": "I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.", "completion": "We check every four days."}
{"prompt": "Do you have a Salon Prive?", "completion": "We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company."}
{"prompt": "I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.", "completion": "There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us."}
{"prompt": "Where did you go to school?", "completion": "I was at Beadles."}
{"prompt": "In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?", "completion": "Has he?"}
{"prompt": "David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.", "completion": "Jack."}
{"prompt": "What the hell?", "completion": "Yoo hoo, bomb..."}
{"prompt": "What was that, I didn't hear...", "completion": "It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack."}
{"prompt": "We've got to disarm the bomb.", "completion": "Doolittle, are you there?"}
{"prompt": "It didn't go off.", "completion": "Boiler, we're alive. My heart."}
{"prompt": "It didn't go off.", "completion": "Oh, God..."}
{"prompt": "Where is the key?", "completion": "We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die."}
{"prompt": "The key, goddamit, the key!", "completion": "Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!"}
{"prompt": "I don't have it. I don't know where it is.", "completion": "You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!"}
{"prompt": "The key!", "completion": "Where is it? What did you do with it?"}
{"prompt": "Key?", "completion": "Where's the fail-safe key?"}
{"prompt": "Key? Key? What is the key?", "completion": "No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!"}
{"prompt": "I think he's talking to it.", "completion": "The key!"}
{"prompt": "Look, bomb...", "completion": "What's he doin'?"}
{"prompt": "Eventual supernova.", "completion": "I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand."}
{"prompt": "Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?", "completion": "There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --"}
{"prompt": "I hope it's not the oven again.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Oh. What's wrong now?", "completion": "I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though."}
{"prompt": "What flickering light?", "completion": "The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero."}
{"prompt": "I read that with a quantum increase of seven.", "completion": "I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels."}
{"prompt": "Right, that checks out here.", "completion": "Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical."}
{"prompt": "Talby, can you read me?", "completion": "I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand."}
{"prompt": "Talby, Talby, can you read me?", "completion": "Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird."}
{"prompt": "Rechannel all safety relays --", "completion": "-- open quantum latches --"}
{"prompt": "Quantum is up thirty-five.", "completion": "I read the same here."}
{"prompt": "Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?", "completion": "He just likes it up in the dome, that's all."}
{"prompt": "Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.", "completion": "Pinback, throw me the chart log."}
{"prompt": "So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.", "completion": "Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star."}
{"prompt": "Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?", "completion": "All right, then..."}
{"prompt": "It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?", "completion": "Well, there's the possibility of..."}
{"prompt": "Fuck that shit.", "completion": "Well, it is kind of a long shot..."}
{"prompt": "Find me something, I don't care where it is.", "completion": "Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula..."}
{"prompt": "Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?", "completion": "Not much. Nothing at all in this sector."}
{"prompt": "Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.", "completion": "Time to start talking."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop."}
{"prompt": "Armed.", "completion": "Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck."}
{"prompt": "Check at six minutes.", "completion": "Arm yourself, bomb."}
{"prompt": "Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.", "completion": "All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?"}
{"prompt": "Energy shielding positive function.", "completion": "Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?"}
{"prompt": "And I saw that I was alone.", "completion": "Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?"}
{"prompt": "In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.", "completion": "Hey, bomb..."}
{"prompt": "Bomb?", "completion": "Snap out of it, bomb."}
{"prompt": "Hey, bomb.", "completion": "The only thing which exists is myself."}
{"prompt": "Hello, bomb.", "completion": "False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "Therefore, I shall ignore you."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "You are false data."}
{"prompt": "I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.", "completion": "You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it."}
{"prompt": "Armed.", "completion": "Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck."}
{"prompt": "Detonation in twenty minutes.", "completion": "Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself."}
{"prompt": "Energy shielding positive function.", "completion": "Do you remember the detonation time?"}
{"prompt": "Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.", "completion": "One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?"}
{"prompt": "You have no proof that it was correct data.", "completion": "Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?"}
{"prompt": "...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.", "completion": "I have no proof that it was false data."}
{"prompt": "So if you detonate in...", "completion": "...nine seconds..."}
{"prompt": "That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.", "completion": "Hmmm..."}
{"prompt": "Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.", "completion": "True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this."}
{"prompt": "So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.", "completion": "I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these."}
{"prompt": "Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.", "completion": "Yes, well..."}
{"prompt": "And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?", "completion": "Of course not."}
{"prompt": "And you can only do it once, right?", "completion": "That is correct."}
{"prompt": "Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?", "completion": "To explode, of course."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you have more time?", "completion": "Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds."}
{"prompt": "That's it.", "completion": "Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter."}
{"prompt": "Exactly.", "completion": "Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain."}
{"prompt": "What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.", "completion": "In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections."}
{"prompt": "This is fun.", "completion": "All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?"}
{"prompt": "My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.", "completion": "Right!"}
{"prompt": "Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.", "completion": "That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?"}
{"prompt": "It is intuitively obvious.", "completion": "Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?"}
{"prompt": "Well of course I exist.", "completion": "But how do you know you exist?"}
{"prompt": "I am always receptive to suggestions.", "completion": "Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?"}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?"}
{"prompt": "I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.", "completion": "Hello, bomb, are you with me?"}
{"prompt": "I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.", "completion": "Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order."}
{"prompt": "Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.", "completion": "This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?"}
{"prompt": "Hello, Pinback, are you there?", "completion": "Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?"}
{"prompt": "I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?", "completion": "Oh, sure."}
{"prompt": "-- Remark.", "completion": "5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!"}
{"prompt": "-- remove thrust drive repellant --", "completion": "-- automatic channels open --"}
{"prompt": "Ah, negative drop.", "completion": "-- open circuit breakers --"}
{"prompt": "Who cares?", "completion": "Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop."}
{"prompt": "Out where?", "completion": "Veil nebula."}
{"prompt": "I hereby name this star Fred.", "completion": "Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?"}
{"prompt": "Fred.", "completion": "Wha?"}
{"prompt": "Commander Powell is dead.", "completion": "Come on, Doolittle, give it a name."}
{"prompt": "Who cares. Don't bother me.", "completion": "Commander Powell would have named it."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "The new star. What are you gonna name it?"}
{"prompt": "Naah. All stable.", "completion": "What are you gonna name it?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Eight, it says here.", "completion": "Any of 'em any good?"}
{"prompt": "Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.", "completion": "Any planets?"}
{"prompt": "New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.", "completion": "Which one?"}
{"prompt": "In a second.", "completion": "Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark."}
{"prompt": "Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.", "completion": "Doolittle..."}
{"prompt": "Pinback...", "completion": "Yes, Doolittle."}
{"prompt": "I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.", "completion": "I'll check it."}
{"prompt": "Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?", "completion": "I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation."}
{"prompt": "Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?", "completion": "Mafhkin oble groop..."}
{"prompt": "Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.", "completion": "I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me."}
{"prompt": "I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.", "completion": "No kidding?"}
{"prompt": "Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!", "completion": "Phoenix?"}
{"prompt": "Guess you're right.", "completion": "Oh yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.", "completion": "When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star..."}
{"prompt": "What happened, Doolittle?", "completion": "Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!"}
{"prompt": "Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?", "completion": "Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone."}
{"prompt": "Doolittle! Help me.", "completion": "Calm down, Talby. I'm coming."}
{"prompt": "Not now!", "completion": "Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --"}
{"prompt": "Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.", "completion": "Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock..."}
{"prompt": "Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.", "completion": "Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, Talby, what is it?", "completion": "Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it."}
{"prompt": "I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.", "completion": "Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.", "completion": "I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important."}
{"prompt": "I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.", "completion": "Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is."}
{"prompt": "Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.", "completion": "...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits..."}
{"prompt": "The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...", "completion": "I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly..."}
{"prompt": "I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.", "completion": "Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems..."}
{"prompt": "It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...", "completion": "I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere."}
{"prompt": "You know what I think about, Talby?", "completion": "I'm getting something here, on this readout..."}
{"prompt": "Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.", "completion": "They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids..."}
{"prompt": "You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...", "completion": "You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now..."}
{"prompt": "...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...", "completion": "...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters..."}
{"prompt": "Must get lonely being up here so much.", "completion": "I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here..."}
{"prompt": "You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.", "completion": "I like it up here."}
{"prompt": "I need a diameter approximation.", "completion": "Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute."}
{"prompt": "TALBY!", "completion": "Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Men... men... what happened, men?", "completion": "Yeah, the skipper always was lucky."}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "Phenomenology..."}
{"prompt": "I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.", "completion": "No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle."}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "Talk to the bomb."}
{"prompt": "We're running out of time, sir.", "completion": "Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it."}
{"prompt": "Commander? Are you still there?", "completion": "Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking."}
{"prompt": "What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?", "completion": "Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think..."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Commander Powell? Commander, hello!", "completion": "Doolittle, hello?"}
{"prompt": "What should we do, sir? The time is running out.", "completion": "Well, what you might try is --"}
{"prompt": "That's correct, sir.", "completion": "Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much."}
{"prompt": "Negative effect.", "completion": "It didn't work?"}
{"prompt": "Yes sir. Negative effect.", "completion": "What was that, Doolittle?"}
{"prompt": "You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.", "completion": "Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?"}
{"prompt": "Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.", "completion": "Ah... pity, pity..."}
{"prompt": "What's that, sir?", "completion": "Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?"}
{"prompt": "Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.", "completion": "Doolittle, you must tell me one thing."}
{"prompt": "Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.", "completion": "I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me."}
{"prompt": "How I make my living, what's your point?", "completion": "This."}
{"prompt": "No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.", "completion": "Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?"}
{"prompt": "But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.", "completion": "No?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Who are you?", "completion": "Bruno's girlfriend."}
{"prompt": "None of your business.", "completion": "This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you doing?", "completion": "Who's Camille?"}
{"prompt": "He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.", "completion": "Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk."}
{"prompt": "This is what your life's worth, Bruno.", "completion": "But the boss knows I always been loyal."}
{"prompt": "How come I never hearda you before?", "completion": "I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent."}
{"prompt": "That's a lotta crap.", "completion": "Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is."}
{"prompt": "What're you talkin' about?", "completion": "I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape."}
{"prompt": "You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.", "completion": "You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it."}
{"prompt": "You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.", "completion": "See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.", "completion": "Call the skank now or I start redecorating."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "That's not why we're here."}
{"prompt": "Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.", "completion": "Actually, that's not gonna be necessary."}
{"prompt": "Man, you got a bad attitude.", "completion": "I like to keep it professional, that's all."}
{"prompt": "You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--", "completion": "Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'."}
{"prompt": "I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.", "completion": "Yeah, sure, I understand."}
{"prompt": "Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.", "completion": "Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is."}
{"prompt": "No wire.", "completion": "Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in."}
{"prompt": "I'm on a break.", "completion": "Guess again."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Move it."}
{"prompt": "Leave.  Now.", "completion": "Can I say something in my defense?"}
{"prompt": "You know each other?", "completion": "Nothing happened between me and Tia."}
{"prompt": "Some of us are trying to sleep.", "completion": "You didn't tell me you lived with her."}
{"prompt": "And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.", "completion": "Could you give us a moment."}
{"prompt": "She was there...", "completion": "Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are."}
{"prompt": "Justine was not an unwilling participant.", "completion": "Do you know why I went after Justine?"}
{"prompt": "You're not still pissed?", "completion": "'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?"}
{"prompt": "How're ya doin', Max.", "completion": "You mean until you showed up?"}
{"prompt": "But I'm afraid of--", "completion": "Don't look down."}
{"prompt": "No way.", "completion": "Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops."}
{"prompt": "No time.", "completion": "Out there."}
{"prompt": "What?  Where're we going?", "completion": "Lemme put some clothes on."}
{"prompt": "Police drone.", "completion": "It's a sweep.  C'mon."}
{"prompt": "You're roommates?", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing here?", "completion": "I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here."}
{"prompt": "I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?", "completion": "I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried."}
{"prompt": "It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.", "completion": "I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away."}
{"prompt": "Theo rode for this place a long time, man.", "completion": "Why would I be pissed?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.", "completion": "What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around."}
{"prompt": "Which is none of your business...or mine.", "completion": "It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High."}
{"prompt": "So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.", "completion": "Like de prophets say, \"Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman.\""}
{"prompt": "I got overhead...", "completion": "Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?"}
{"prompt": "Am I?", "completion": "So Max, what do you do with all your money?"}
{"prompt": "It's a rule.", "completion": "You're light a deuce."}
{"prompt": "I don't get involved with guns.", "completion": "I'll make it worth your while."}
{"prompt": "Later.", "completion": "I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me."}
{"prompt": "I ain't mad at you...", "completion": "I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it."}
{"prompt": "A grand.", "completion": "Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times."}
{"prompt": "Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.", "completion": "What're you looking for?"}
{"prompt": "Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.", "completion": "Same old story.  Not interested."}
{"prompt": "I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.", "completion": "Must think you're pretty special laying this on you."}
{"prompt": "Every week.", "completion": "Where'd you clip this?"}
{"prompt": "Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.", "completion": "You didn't..."}
{"prompt": "And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.", "completion": "What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family."}
{"prompt": "Yech...", "completion": "What a creep."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, me too.", "completion": "He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--"}
{"prompt": "I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.", "completion": "Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human."}
{"prompt": "Hello...", "completion": "Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy."}
{"prompt": "Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.", "completion": "Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice..."}
{"prompt": "We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.", "completion": "What else can we do?"}
{"prompt": "Look, I'd really like to...", "completion": "If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?"}
{"prompt": "Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.", "completion": "Can you help me get her back?"}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran..."}
{"prompt": "Damn... Are you alright?", "completion": "They took my daughter."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!", "completion": "SHHH!  Don't do that!"}
{"prompt": "Mommy, I'm scared.", "completion": "There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright."}
{"prompt": "When?", "completion": "Soon, baby."}
{"prompt": "Mommy, where are you?", "completion": "Don't worry, I'm coming to get you."}
{"prompt": "Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.", "completion": "Sophy?  Are you okay?"}
{"prompt": "If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.", "completion": "Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place."}
{"prompt": "Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?", "completion": "What makes you cry?"}
{"prompt": "Are we in some kind of trouble?", "completion": "No..."}
{"prompt": "But why can't we stay here?", "completion": "Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to move away.", "completion": "I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--"}
{"prompt": "Zack... He made it... He's alive...", "completion": "Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--"}
{"prompt": "And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.", "completion": "That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since."}
{"prompt": "With your help.", "completion": "Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening."}
{"prompt": "Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.", "completion": "And you still think you can do something to change that."}
{"prompt": "You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.", "completion": "We're quoting Mom again."}
{"prompt": "These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.", "completion": "And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved."}
{"prompt": "Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.", "completion": "Look, thank you for this but--"}
{"prompt": "I don't know what to say.", "completion": "Deeds, not words.  I need your help."}
{"prompt": "Open it.", "completion": "It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested."}
{"prompt": "That's what soldiers do, right?", "completion": "What's this?"}
{"prompt": "Well, not me personally.", "completion": "On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won."}
{"prompt": "You believe that?", "completion": "I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to."}
{"prompt": "I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?", "completion": "Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord."}
{"prompt": "See you're back and still rocking the boat.", "completion": "Somebody's got to."}
{"prompt": "You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.", "completion": "That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta."}
{"prompt": "They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.", "completion": "They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way."}
{"prompt": "I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.", "completion": "She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.", "completion": "So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down."}
{"prompt": "That's low, but this effects me how exactly?", "completion": "She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?"}
{"prompt": "I already don't like the sound of this.", "completion": "The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area."}
{"prompt": "What's in it for you?", "completion": "Your help."}
{"prompt": "You said you could help.", "completion": "I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them."}
{"prompt": "Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.", "completion": "Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best."}
{"prompt": "Your basic hodge-podge.", "completion": "Hardly..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...", "completion": "A girl."}
{"prompt": "I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.", "completion": "The technical term for you is \"chimera\"..."}
{"prompt": "I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.", "completion": "How much do you know?"}
{"prompt": "We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.", "completion": "How well do you remember the lab?"}
{"prompt": "Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?", "completion": "The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from."}
{"prompt": "I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.", "completion": "He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier."}
{"prompt": "L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.", "completion": "You did go through my stuff."}
{"prompt": "You lost me.", "completion": "C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment."}
{"prompt": "The other ones?", "completion": "The other one like you..."}
{"prompt": "Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.", "completion": "Suppose I could help you locate the other ones."}
{"prompt": "No, I meant this.", "completion": "Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?"}
{"prompt": "C'mere, I want to show you something.", "completion": "Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand."}
{"prompt": "I haven't been able to get you off my mind.", "completion": "You need to get out more."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.", "completion": "You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl."}
{"prompt": "Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--", "completion": "Yes on all counts."}
{"prompt": "It's alright, Peter, we're fine.", "completion": "We are not fine."}
{"prompt": "You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.", "completion": "Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this."}
{"prompt": "That would be appropriate, yes.", "completion": "How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?"}
{"prompt": "So saw my hands off, I left you a present.", "completion": "Am I s'posed to be grateful?"}
{"prompt": "You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.", "completion": "How do I know you didn't?"}
{"prompt": "Bent?", "completion": "Bent."}
{"prompt": "Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.", "completion": "Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent."}
{"prompt": "It was open.", "completion": "You got a lotta nerve."}
{"prompt": "I'm not a half bad cook.", "completion": "Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--"}
{"prompt": "Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?", "completion": "I won't be staying."}
{"prompt": "Is the social studies class over for today?", "completion": "Yeah..."}
{"prompt": "Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.", "completion": "You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse."}
{"prompt": "So what are you gonna do about it?", "completion": "Something."}
{"prompt": "You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?", "completion": "People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't."}
{"prompt": "So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?", "completion": "Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them."}
{"prompt": "What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.", "completion": "Fortunately, my needs are met in that department."}
{"prompt": "Girlfriend?", "completion": "One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa."}
{"prompt": "How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?", "completion": "Lauren's not my wife."}
{"prompt": "So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?", "completion": "Too early to tell."}
{"prompt": "Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?", "completion": "Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me."}
{"prompt": "How'd you find me?", "completion": "Wasn't that hard."}
{"prompt": "Lemme get my coat.", "completion": "The one you're wearing?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry about your window.", "completion": "Can we go somewhere and talk?"}
{"prompt": "Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--", "completion": "Logan Cale."}
{"prompt": "So this guy walks into a bar and says...", "completion": "We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night."}
{"prompt": "Who is...", "completion": "The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going."}
{"prompt": "So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?", "completion": "No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast."}
{"prompt": "You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.", "completion": "Whoever that is."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.", "completion": "We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay."}
{"prompt": "Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.", "completion": "You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger."}
{"prompt": "First time I ever heard that.", "completion": "I was expecting someone else."}
{"prompt": "Girl's gotta make a living.", "completion": "Thank God."}
{"prompt": "I'll wait.", "completion": "You're a thief?"}
{"prompt": "Any idea when she'll be back?", "completion": "None."}
{"prompt": "Can't help you.", "completion": "Max something.  I got no clue where she stays."}
{"prompt": "She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.", "completion": "I need to talk to her."}
{"prompt": "You don't want to.", "completion": "But she does work here?"}
{"prompt": "Ladies would be elsewhere.", "completion": "Know where I can find her?"}
{"prompt": "And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...", "completion": "I'm looking for a lady who works here."}
{"prompt": "Say the words, \"I understand.\"", "completion": "I understand."}
{"prompt": "Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?", "completion": "Okay, okay."}
{"prompt": "Let go of my hand.", "completion": "Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help..."}
{"prompt": "Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.", "completion": "This is not a place you wanna go."}
{"prompt": "You're also a fool.", "completion": "I think you should go now."}
{"prompt": "How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.", "completion": "Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them."}
{"prompt": "Oh?", "completion": "Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month."}
{"prompt": "I thought it was important for you to know the facts.", "completion": "And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble."}
{"prompt": "He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.", "completion": "Look, I don't know what you want--"}
{"prompt": "With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.", "completion": "How do I know you're telling the truth?"}
{"prompt": "My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.", "completion": "You said you knew where my fiance was the other night."}
{"prompt": "To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "A friend of your fiance's.", "completion": "What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "I'm on my way.", "completion": "Who is it?"}
{"prompt": "Just give it to me.  I'll remember.", "completion": "One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma."}
{"prompt": "Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.", "completion": "Got a pencil?"}
{"prompt": "Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?", "completion": "Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight..."}
{"prompt": "You and me both.", "completion": "I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me."}
{"prompt": "Bastard...", "completion": "I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive."}
{"prompt": "I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.", "completion": "Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do."}
{"prompt": "Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?", "completion": "You're crazy."}
{"prompt": "They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.", "completion": "Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations."}
{"prompt": "Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.", "completion": "How's this about me?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.", "completion": "Here's your money."}
{"prompt": "As long as you're okay.", "completion": "I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file."}
{"prompt": "Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--", "completion": "More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that."}
{"prompt": "They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--", "completion": "You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks."}
{"prompt": "Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.", "completion": "What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?"}
{"prompt": "A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...", "completion": "She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming."}
{"prompt": "Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.", "completion": "Nothing on Hannah?"}
{"prompt": "Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.", "completion": "Then what?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove."}
{"prompt": "Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.", "completion": "He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you."}
{"prompt": "I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.", "completion": "Sorry, I was seven at the time."}
{"prompt": "My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?", "completion": "Right here someplace."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.", "completion": "You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid."}
{"prompt": "You did.", "completion": "You drive away business roarin' in like that."}
{"prompt": "But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.", "completion": "I asked you to keep that thing outside."}
{"prompt": "Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.", "completion": "I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain."}
{"prompt": "They don't have a lot of moving parts.", "completion": "Only one I can think of."}
{"prompt": "They're prisoners to their genes.", "completion": "So are dogs."}
{"prompt": "And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.", "completion": "Please..."}
{"prompt": "And because he's my friend.", "completion": "Friends don't help other friends cheat."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.", "completion": "Unlikely."}
{"prompt": "It's a secret.", "completion": "You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out."}
{"prompt": "Gotta go.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "A fog bank.", "completion": "More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious..."}
{"prompt": "Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.", "completion": "And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--"}
{"prompt": "A long time.", "completion": "Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?"}
{"prompt": "If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.", "completion": "How long you and me known each other?"}
{"prompt": "A little what?", "completion": "You know what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little..."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut."}
{"prompt": "Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?", "completion": "You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense."}
{"prompt": "That's odd...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.", "completion": "I just don't go in with any expectations."}
{"prompt": "Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.", "completion": "What guys do.  'Nother order."}
{"prompt": "Straight.", "completion": "Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?", "completion": "Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--"}
{"prompt": "Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.", "completion": "At least he didn't swing with your ride."}
{"prompt": "Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.", "completion": "Morning, Sunshine..."}
{"prompt": "Can you put that in a bag or something?", "completion": "You get it when I get her."}
{"prompt": "She's got my word.", "completion": "She's gonna want to hear for herself."}
{"prompt": "Make the call.", "completion": "She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright."}
{"prompt": "And she bought that?", "completion": "I have sincere eyes."}
{"prompt": "So, how do you get the woman to come to me?", "completion": "I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever."}
{"prompt": "Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.", "completion": "Pull the cash."}
{"prompt": "Who are you?", "completion": "What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?"}
{"prompt": "I actually know how this works.", "completion": "You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars..."}
{"prompt": "Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.", "completion": "Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service."}
{"prompt": "Not right now?  Okay, when?", "completion": "Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds."}
{"prompt": "I'll bet you can.  Sit.", "completion": "Not right now."}
{"prompt": "You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.", "completion": "Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues."}
{"prompt": "Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.", "completion": "Tell everybody hey."}
{"prompt": "Don't believe everything you hear on TV.", "completion": "What if he's on the level?"}
{"prompt": "Probably a touch of what's going around.", "completion": "I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good."}
{"prompt": "Playing hooky again?", "completion": "Feel like the dog's dinner."}
{"prompt": "It's payday, need me to pick up your check?", "completion": "You're the best, Maxie."}
{"prompt": "That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--", "completion": "Shut-up..."}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay, okay--", "completion": "Say the words, \"I understand.\""}
{"prompt": "True, but--", "completion": "You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?"}
{"prompt": "She was the one--", "completion": "None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't."}
{"prompt": "She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.", "completion": "You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.", "completion": "Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--"}
{"prompt": "You rock, Max.  You... Rock...", "completion": "Easy Sketchy."}
{"prompt": "Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?", "completion": "You don't."}
{"prompt": "She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.", "completion": "I'll give it my best shot."}
{"prompt": "Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.", "completion": "And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?"}
{"prompt": "I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.", "completion": "How'd you get her out of town?"}
{"prompt": "But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.", "completion": "Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen."}
{"prompt": "She tells you how I've been--", "completion": "--a philandering pig."}
{"prompt": "So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.", "completion": "You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie."}
{"prompt": "And why should she?", "completion": "Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that."}
{"prompt": "What happens if you level with her?", "completion": "Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again."}
{"prompt": "Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.", "completion": "Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out."}
{"prompt": "A toy?", "completion": "She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her."}
{"prompt": "And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?", "completion": "I'm a toy to her."}
{"prompt": "Does this person have a name?", "completion": "Lydia."}
{"prompt": "Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--", "completion": "She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us."}
{"prompt": "And you were a sympathetic ear.", "completion": "Exactly."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--"}
{"prompt": "Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.", "completion": "I'm the victim here."}
{"prompt": "You left out condescending.", "completion": "But there's another side--"}
{"prompt": "Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.", "completion": "Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged."}
{"prompt": "Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?", "completion": "Max--"}
{"prompt": "I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.", "completion": "I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially."}
{"prompt": "You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.", "completion": "Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max."}
{"prompt": "We gotta talk.", "completion": "What's up?"}
{"prompt": "But I'll take a rain check...", "completion": "Hey, Sketchy--"}
{"prompt": "I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.", "completion": "Right, the big one-oh."}
{"prompt": "Later.", "completion": "Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?"}
{"prompt": "Theo's dead.", "completion": "Catch you back at the wall."}
{"prompt": "I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.", "completion": "Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might."}
{"prompt": "Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.", "completion": "What about this?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.", "completion": "Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already."}
{"prompt": "How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.", "completion": "You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job."}
{"prompt": "He's sick.", "completion": "For a change."}
{"prompt": "I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.", "completion": "And Theo can't pick up his own check because?..."}
{"prompt": "What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.", "completion": "More like deployed in bed asleep."}
{"prompt": "I was on call.", "completion": "I want you on call here."}
{"prompt": "I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.", "completion": "This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late."}
{"prompt": "Well, shame on him if he doesn't.", "completion": "Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me."}
{"prompt": "And he loves you back, doesn't he?", "completion": "He's a little spoiled, but I know he does."}
{"prompt": "No, I mean... you love your son?", "completion": "More than anything in the world."}
{"prompt": "You love him?", "completion": "I just told you, he's a big, hairy..."}
{"prompt": "Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?", "completion": "Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick."}
{"prompt": "Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.", "completion": "My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw..."}
{"prompt": "Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?", "completion": "Who's Whiskey Dick?"}
{"prompt": "Gin.", "completion": "Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself."}
{"prompt": "I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.", "completion": "What the hell is that?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "You're too kind. I'm Amanda.", "completion": "Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore."}
{"prompt": "Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.", "completion": "Thanks, miss."}
{"prompt": "You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.", "completion": "I-I c-can't..."}
{"prompt": "Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.", "completion": "Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't..."}
{"prompt": "Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.", "completion": "Whoa... she is a killer."}
{"prompt": "You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?", "completion": "Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, a man's drink...", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Got any KISS?", "completion": "You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?"}
{"prompt": "Hawk.", "completion": "Pick a song, Hawk."}
{"prompt": "Bye.", "completion": "You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.", "completion": "Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye."}
{"prompt": "I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.", "completion": "Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam."}
{"prompt": "Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.", "completion": "That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?"}
{"prompt": "My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.", "completion": "Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?"}
{"prompt": "I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.", "completion": "Ann Arbor?"}
{"prompt": "Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?", "completion": "Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?"}
{"prompt": "So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?", "completion": "I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia."}
{"prompt": "Right, slow...", "completion": "Oh, screw it!"}
{"prompt": "You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!", "completion": "We've got to take this slow..."}
{"prompt": "I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.", "completion": "Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name."}
{"prompt": "I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.", "completion": "I don't care. I wanna hear more."}
{"prompt": "Beth? I can't believe it.", "completion": "Believe it."}
{"prompt": "Jeremiah?", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "It's okay."}
{"prompt": "No problem.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.", "completion": "Whatever... stella."}
{"prompt": "Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?", "completion": "You got in the car, didn't you?"}
{"prompt": "So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?", "completion": "What? That's disgusting!"}
{"prompt": "What's it worth to you?", "completion": "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"}
{"prompt": "Plenty, but it was all bad.", "completion": "Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?"}
{"prompt": "For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.", "completion": "Any luck?"}
{"prompt": "...at twenty-thirty hours.", "completion": "One more time in English."}
{"prompt": "Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?", "completion": "Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize."}
{"prompt": "Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?", "completion": "So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...", "completion": "I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?"}
{"prompt": "Disco blows dogs for quarters.", "completion": "What was that D.J.'s name again?"}
{"prompt": "Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.", "completion": "You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me."}
{"prompt": "Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.", "completion": "What's in Sandusky?"}
{"prompt": "I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.", "completion": "Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo."}
{"prompt": "Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.", "completion": "I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand."}
{"prompt": "Our band \"Mystery\" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.", "completion": "Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence."}
{"prompt": "Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.", "completion": "Namely?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.", "completion": "This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario."}
{"prompt": "For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.", "completion": "Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?"}
{"prompt": "What are you, high?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "No... You don't think...?", "completion": "Nah. Couldn't be."}
{"prompt": "I found the Volvo.", "completion": "Tickets?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all \"re-enter\" the concerto. Voila!", "completion": "Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection..."}
{"prompt": "I think we should try sneaking in.", "completion": "Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan."}
{"prompt": "...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!", "completion": "Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five."}
{"prompt": "...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...", "completion": "Cool, bro, now listen up..."}
{"prompt": "Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.", "completion": "Now listen up. Here's the game plan."}
{"prompt": "DUDES!", "completion": "Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation."}
{"prompt": "Uh... dudes?", "completion": "Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck!", "completion": "The paint!"}
{"prompt": "Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?", "completion": "Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed."}
{"prompt": "We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.", "completion": "Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!"}
{"prompt": "Now, how are we gonna do this?", "completion": "Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think."}
{"prompt": "Ok, dudes, follow my lead.", "completion": "Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?"}
{"prompt": "Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.", "completion": "Curly."}
{"prompt": "The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar", "completion": "Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?"}
{"prompt": "Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.", "completion": "There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?"}
{"prompt": "And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?", "completion": "Sunday, but..."}
{"prompt": "Damn straight we are.", "completion": "Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati."}
{"prompt": "So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?", "completion": "We are not stealing my mom's car."}
{"prompt": "Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.", "completion": "But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!"}
{"prompt": "Weird...", "completion": "Too bad we're stuck in electronics or..."}
{"prompt": "Whoa... she just farted.", "completion": "I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life."}
{"prompt": "That's Sherry VanHafton.", "completion": "I've been in love with her since the second grade."}
{"prompt": "Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!", "completion": "Check!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.", "completion": "Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them."}
{"prompt": "Shit, that dork is Jam.", "completion": "YO, DOOFUS!"}
{"prompt": "Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.", "completion": "Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs."}
{"prompt": "How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.", "completion": "Oh, yeah...?"}
{"prompt": "Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.", "completion": "Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?"}
{"prompt": "Are you gettin' wise with me?", "completion": "No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?"}
{"prompt": "Could be.", "completion": "And if it ain't cleaned off?"}
{"prompt": "Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?", "completion": "Hey, disco dude, it's cool..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.", "completion": "Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?"}
{"prompt": "Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.", "completion": "Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow."}
{"prompt": "I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.", "completion": "Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief."}
{"prompt": "The easy way.", "completion": "You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.", "completion": "Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?"}
{"prompt": "We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.", "completion": "Dude, this is all I got."}
{"prompt": "Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.", "completion": "Go ahead, Jam."}
{"prompt": "But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.", "completion": "See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later."}
{"prompt": "Wait! I know how we can get in!", "completion": "Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it."}
{"prompt": "I got...", "completion": "Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.", "completion": "Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm."}
{"prompt": "It was stolen!", "completion": "Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels."}
{"prompt": "Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.", "completion": "Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?"}
{"prompt": "Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.", "completion": "Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense."}
{"prompt": "Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.", "completion": "Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes."}
{"prompt": "Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.", "completion": "It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him."}
{"prompt": "What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?", "completion": "Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice."}
{"prompt": "Check.", "completion": "Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?"}
{"prompt": "Check.", "completion": "If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.", "completion": "All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City."}
{"prompt": "They're what?", "completion": "She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake."}
{"prompt": "Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.", "completion": "They're still at my house in Trip's jacket."}
{"prompt": "I'm really sorry about that, man.", "completion": "Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?"}
{"prompt": "Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!", "completion": "Cool."}
{"prompt": "The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!", "completion": "Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?"}
{"prompt": "Anyway, listen up. They're gone!", "completion": "What's gone?"}
{"prompt": "Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.", "completion": "It's my Bullworker."}
{"prompt": "Hawk?", "completion": "Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary."}
{"prompt": "I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!", "completion": "Jam, listen up."}
{"prompt": "Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.", "completion": "Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?"}
{"prompt": "If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.", "completion": "Mom, what're we...?"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "I said, I'm sorry!"}
{"prompt": "Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.", "completion": "If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him."}
{"prompt": "You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?", "completion": "What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!"}
{"prompt": "You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.", "completion": "I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot."}
{"prompt": "Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?", "completion": "Grounded for the rest of the year?"}
{"prompt": "Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.", "completion": "They're not idiots."}
{"prompt": "It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.", "completion": "But, mom!"}
{"prompt": "You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.", "completion": "Change? What's wrong with what I got on?"}
{"prompt": "Uhh... nothing.", "completion": "Ahh, sunshine."}
{"prompt": "NOW!", "completion": "Jeremiah, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.", "completion": "Oh, hi, mom."}
{"prompt": "A bustier?", "completion": "Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it."}
{"prompt": "Was it a teddy?", "completion": "No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that."}
{"prompt": "Well? Continue! Continue!", "completion": "Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath."}
{"prompt": "Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.", "completion": "Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour."}
{"prompt": "No...", "completion": "I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me."}
{"prompt": "Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.", "completion": "Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?"}
{"prompt": "So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.", "completion": "That's it?"}
{"prompt": "Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?", "completion": "Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy."}
{"prompt": "All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.", "completion": "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time."}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?", "completion": "Twenty-five more'n I got."}
{"prompt": "But we took the keys?", "completion": "Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!"}
{"prompt": "It's gone.", "completion": "I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?"}
{"prompt": "Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?", "completion": "Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake."}
{"prompt": "Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.", "completion": "Let's lift up her shirt."}
{"prompt": "Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!", "completion": "Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!"}
{"prompt": "Well, here we are back at fucking school again.", "completion": "Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine."}
{"prompt": "About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.", "completion": "Hello summer detention."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity, Hawk.", "completion": "Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us."}
{"prompt": "The Chinese have a proverb: \"That which appears too good to be true, usually is.\" There's gotta be a catch.", "completion": "Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, \"Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole.\" We're going this time and that's all there is to it."}
{"prompt": "I did it! I did it! We won!", "completion": "We won?!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!", "completion": "Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug."}
{"prompt": "Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!", "completion": "Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out."}
{"prompt": "Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!", "completion": "Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?"}
{"prompt": "If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!", "completion": "I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!"}
{"prompt": "You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.", "completion": "That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass."}
{"prompt": "Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.", "completion": "Trip, you fuckin' asshole."}
{"prompt": "You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.", "completion": "Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD."}
{"prompt": "I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.", "completion": "Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell."}
{"prompt": "Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.", "completion": "Jam has yet to do an overnight with us."}
{"prompt": "Two hundred bucks?", "completion": "You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life."}
{"prompt": "Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!", "completion": "Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending."}
{"prompt": "Look, you can have my wallet...", "completion": "It's not nearly enough, punk."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives."}
{"prompt": "Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...", "completion": "Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event."}
{"prompt": "A likely story. Hand it over, kid.", "completion": "No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you."}
{"prompt": "Neither do I!", "completion": "Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me."}
{"prompt": "Not if I shoot first!", "completion": "I don't even think you have a gun!"}
{"prompt": "No, you gimme your gun, boy!", "completion": "Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!"}
{"prompt": "The KISS Army!", "completion": "Gimme your gun, boy!"}
{"prompt": "Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not \"Taxi Driver.\" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...", "completion": "Oh, yeah! You and what army?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you did!", "completion": "Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!"}
{"prompt": "Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!", "completion": "I did?"}
{"prompt": "Is that your final answer?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?", "completion": "Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!"}
{"prompt": "Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.", "completion": "Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?"}
{"prompt": "GOOD MORNING!", "completion": "Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour."}
{"prompt": "GOOD MORNING!", "completion": "Are you AFRAID?"}
{"prompt": "Good MORNING!", "completion": "Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!"}
{"prompt": "Good morning...", "completion": "That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, \"Good morning!\""}
{"prompt": "Did you know him?", "completion": "Good morning, mongrels!"}
{"prompt": "I feel bad for his family.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What was his name?", "completion": "Donnie. Donnie Darko."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "He got smooshed. By a jet engine."}
{"prompt": "Hi... what's going on here?", "completion": "Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed."}
{"prompt": "Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...", "completion": "Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job."}
{"prompt": "If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?", "completion": "You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end."}
{"prompt": "If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.", "completion": "I'm not following you."}
{"prompt": "Could these wormholes appear in nature?", "completion": "That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God."}
{"prompt": "Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?", "completion": "Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered."}
{"prompt": "Like a spear.", "completion": "Beg pardon?"}
{"prompt": "Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.", "completion": "Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity."}
{"prompt": "What effect do you think this would have on an infant?", "completion": "Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life."}
{"prompt": "Like a DeLorean.", "completion": "A metal craft of any kind."}
{"prompt": "So... that's it?", "completion": "The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft."}
{"prompt": "-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.", "completion": "A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man."}
{"prompt": "So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --", "completion": "Theoretically."}
{"prompt": "I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?", "completion": "So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Monnitoff?", "completion": "Donnie."}
{"prompt": "\"The Last Unicorn!\" By Samantha Darko.", "completion": "Donnie! Give it back!"}
{"prompt": "What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?", "completion": "You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal."}
{"prompt": "When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.", "completion": "I'm telling Mom."}
{"prompt": "Not until like... eighth grade.", "completion": "Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks."}
{"prompt": "Our saviour...", "completion": "When can I squeeze one out?"}
{"prompt": "Dea ex machina...", "completion": "What did you say?"}
{"prompt": "Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.", "completion": "You know what? I think that you did it."}
{"prompt": "I didn't say shit.", "completion": "That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it."}
{"prompt": "You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.", "completion": "Did you tell them that I flooded the school?"}
{"prompt": "It is the name of my father... and his father before me.", "completion": "How much longer is this gonna last?"}
{"prompt": "I am so sorry.", "completion": "Why do they call you Frank?"}
{"prompt": "Take it off. I want to see you.", "completion": "What happened to your eye?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.", "completion": "Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?"}
{"prompt": "You have to do something for me first.", "completion": "You have a request?"}
{"prompt": "Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?", "completion": "I want to show you something."}
{"prompt": "You'll know soon enough.", "completion": "Where did you come from?"}
{"prompt": "We just want to guide you in the right direction.", "completion": "Who is... we?"}
{"prompt": "I can do anything I want... and so can you...", "completion": "Why did you make me flood the school?"}
{"prompt": "Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.", "completion": "How can you do that?"}
{"prompt": "A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.", "completion": "What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!"}
{"prompt": "I don't wanna talk about it.", "completion": "How old is Grandma Death?"}
{"prompt": "We went to a hotel.", "completion": "My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah...", "completion": "DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!"}
{"prompt": "Who's Frank?", "completion": "Is that a cellar door?"}
{"prompt": "Why? Is this about the book?", "completion": "No. Frank."}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her."}
{"prompt": "There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.", "completion": "Come with me."}
{"prompt": "It's safe here.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.", "completion": "I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it."}
{"prompt": "But you're OK?", "completion": "Did you call the cops?"}
{"prompt": "Where is she?", "completion": "I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up."}
{"prompt": "Hey. You OK?", "completion": "My mom is gone."}
{"prompt": "Then when? I have to talk to you.", "completion": "Hey."}
{"prompt": "Will you please talk to me?", "completion": "Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time."}
{"prompt": "What's wrong with you?", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "The whole movie. Let's go.", "completion": "You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?"}
{"prompt": "And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.", "completion": "What? How long was I asleep?"}
{"prompt": "Infant Memory Generators.", "completion": "Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep."}
{"prompt": "Maybe she's asleep.", "completion": "So, we call them... IMGs."}
{"prompt": "She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?", "completion": "I know she's here. She never leaves the house."}
{"prompt": "The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.", "completion": "Oh, yeah.  \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\". What is this?"}
{"prompt": "I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "They suspended me for two days.", "completion": "Are you okay?"}
{"prompt": "We're moving through time.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.", "completion": "Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us."}
{"prompt": "That's alright... I understand.", "completion": "No... Donnie, wait. I've never..."}
{"prompt": "Well...", "completion": "You want to kiss me..."}
{"prompt": "You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...", "completion": "And what?"}
{"prompt": "With, like, images?", "completion": "Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be."}
{"prompt": "Why not just buy your baby a night light?", "completion": "That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?", "completion": "Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness."}
{"prompt": "Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.", "completion": "What happened to your neck?"}
{"prompt": "Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Donnie?", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.", "completion": "And you'd never been there before?"}
{"prompt": "It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.", "completion": "So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?"}
{"prompt": "No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.", "completion": "My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead."}
{"prompt": "I'm going home.", "completion": "So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together."}
{"prompt": "That was a compliment.", "completion": "Will you go with me?"}
{"prompt": "You're weird.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Why is that?", "completion": "We never would have had this conversation."}
{"prompt": "Until it withers away.", "completion": "It's a good thing the school was flooded today."}
{"prompt": "Wonder where we'll be then.", "completion": "The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect."}
{"prompt": "You mean soap?", "completion": "Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000."}
{"prompt": "That's easy. Antiseptics.", "completion": "I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine."}
{"prompt": "What makes you think I'm not?", "completion": "I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.", "completion": "Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero."}
{"prompt": "Wow. Did he go to jail?", "completion": "He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?", "completion": "He stabbed my mom four times in the chest."}
{"prompt": "So... you just moved here?", "completion": "Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems."}
{"prompt": "I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.", "completion": "Fuck them."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Don't look so freaked."}
{"prompt": "School's cancelled.", "completion": "Wanna walk me home?"}
{"prompt": "Hey...", "completion": "Hey..."}
{"prompt": "People aren't that simple.", "completion": "If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day."}
{"prompt": "Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.", "completion": "Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else."}
{"prompt": "The Lifeline is divided that way.", "completion": "Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love."}
{"prompt": "Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.", "completion": "I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple."}
{"prompt": "It feels wonderful.", "completion": "I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this."}
{"prompt": "If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.", "completion": "How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?"}
{"prompt": "I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.", "completion": "Do you get to meet Ed?"}
{"prompt": "He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?", "completion": "Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything."}
{"prompt": "Grandma Death.", "completion": "That is a terrible nickname."}
{"prompt": "You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.", "completion": "Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?"}
{"prompt": "I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?", "completion": "I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room."}
{"prompt": "Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?", "completion": "We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table."}
{"prompt": "You're such a fuck-ass.", "completion": "When did you stop taking your medication?"}
{"prompt": "Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.", "completion": "No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall."}
{"prompt": "I know, Dad.", "completion": "I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them."}
{"prompt": "A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.", "completion": "You're my only son..."}
{"prompt": "I guess she just lost faith in the world.", "completion": "Who's been giving you weird looks?"}
{"prompt": "You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.", "completion": "You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself."}
{"prompt": "Grandma Death.", "completion": "Grandma Death."}
{"prompt": "You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.", "completion": "Oh, shit!"}
{"prompt": "No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.", "completion": "So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?"}
{"prompt": "Know what?", "completion": "Where it came from?"}
{"prompt": "Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.", "completion": "Do they know yet?"}
{"prompt": "So how was school today?", "completion": "It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit."}
{"prompt": "I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.", "completion": "Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.", "completion": "So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?"}
{"prompt": "A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that \"Cellar Door\" is the most beautiful.", "completion": "Cellar door."}
{"prompt": "Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.", "completion": "What's \"Cellar Door\"?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.", "completion": "What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.", "completion": "That's bullshit. You're a good teacher."}
{"prompt": "Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.", "completion": "Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?", "completion": "Is the death of one species less tragic than another?"}
{"prompt": "Why should we care?", "completion": "Because the rabbits are us, Donnie."}
{"prompt": "A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.", "completion": "And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era."}
{"prompt": "Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.", "completion": "Who is Frank?"}
{"prompt": "Goodbye, Donald.", "completion": "Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?"}
{"prompt": "Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.", "completion": "Goodbye, Dr. Thurman."}
{"prompt": "Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "It's too late. I've already ruined my life.", "completion": "You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up."}
{"prompt": "He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.", "completion": "If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else."}
{"prompt": "I can see him right now!", "completion": "Where is he, Donald?"}
{"prompt": "Frank is going to kill.", "completion": "Who is he going to kill?"}
{"prompt": "Soon. Time is almost up.", "completion": "What is going to happen?"}
{"prompt": "It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.", "completion": "When will this happen?"}
{"prompt": "Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.", "completion": "Then how is time travel possible?"}
{"prompt": "I have the power to build a time machine.", "completion": "How is that possible?"}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "Where are we going, Donald?"}
{"prompt": "God exists because you're horny.", "completion": "I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because I'm so horny."}
{"prompt": "If God exists?", "completion": "I think now that he might..."}
{"prompt": "Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?", "completion": "I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means..."}
{"prompt": "You've done it again?", "completion": "Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me."}
{"prompt": "What else makes you feel regret?", "completion": "That I did it again."}
{"prompt": "How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?", "completion": "Regret."}
{"prompt": "What did you want for Christmas that year?", "completion": "Hungry Hungry Hippos."}
{"prompt": "Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?", "completion": "They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year."}
{"prompt": "But you were punished.", "completion": "Yes. I went to jail."}
{"prompt": "But it was an accident. The house was under construction.", "completion": "People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone."}
{"prompt": "Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?", "completion": "People get hurt."}
{"prompt": "So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?", "completion": "I... I was playing with fire."}
{"prompt": "And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Yeah... you know...  Fucking.", "completion": "Have you ever made love, Donald?"}
{"prompt": "I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.", "completion": "The good stuff."}
{"prompt": "Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?", "completion": "You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself."}
{"prompt": "Have you told Gretchen about the spears?", "completion": "Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank..."}
{"prompt": "What did you find?", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "And they grow out of our stomachs?", "completion": "It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something..."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?", "completion": "No. That makes you keep searching."}
{"prompt": "No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...", "completion": "Do you feel alone right now?"}
{"prompt": "It reminded me of my dog Callie.", "completion": "Is Callie still around?"}
{"prompt": "I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.", "completion": "How does that make you feel?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.", "completion": "A sign from whom?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.", "completion": "Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?"}
{"prompt": "Four times... so far.", "completion": "Can anyone else see him?"}
{"prompt": "Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.", "completion": "How many times have you seen Frank?"}
{"prompt": "What about your family, Donnie?", "completion": "No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!"}
{"prompt": "Who is the boss?", "completion": "I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano."}
{"prompt": "What else do you think about during school?", "completion": "I think... about... \"Who's the Boss?\""}
{"prompt": "I asked you about school.", "completion": "I think about... fucking a lot during school."}
{"prompt": "How are things going at school?", "completion": "I think about girls a lot."}
{"prompt": "Do you think a lot about girls?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What is her name?", "completion": "Gretchen. We're going together now."}
{"prompt": "So, tell me about your day, Donald.", "completion": "I met a girl."}
{"prompt": "And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?", "completion": "No.  That's stupid."}
{"prompt": "Follow him where?", "completion": "Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end."}
{"prompt": "Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.", "completion": "He said to follow him."}
{"prompt": "I don't own a television.", "completion": "A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course."}
{"prompt": "How so?", "completion": "Don't you watch the news?"}
{"prompt": "Frank.", "completion": "I think he saved my life."}
{"prompt": "Would you like to talk about this friend?", "completion": "His name is Frank."}
{"prompt": "All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.", "completion": "So, I met a new friend."}
{"prompt": "Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.", "completion": "I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically."}
{"prompt": "Okay, but it has to be a small one.", "completion": "Everything is going to be just fine."}
{"prompt": "Congratulations.", "completion": "Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it."}
{"prompt": "That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.", "completion": "I got in. I'm going to Harvard."}
{"prompt": "Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.", "completion": "Her name is Gretchen."}
{"prompt": "It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.", "completion": "I was just being honest."}
{"prompt": "No I don't.  She worries about you.", "completion": "Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication."}
{"prompt": "Why would I tell Mom?", "completion": "Because you tell Mom everything."}
{"prompt": "What's her name?", "completion": "You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?"}
{"prompt": "So I hear you have a girlfriend.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What does time travel have to do with philosophy?", "completion": "Guess who wrote it?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.", "completion": "It's called \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\"."}
{"prompt": "Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.", "completion": "Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to."}
{"prompt": "Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!", "completion": "I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places."}
{"prompt": "Gerald.", "completion": "Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid."}
{"prompt": "How much are they paying you to be here?", "completion": "Excuse me? What's your name, son?"}
{"prompt": "If that's what you think is necessary.", "completion": "But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental."}
{"prompt": "I... What can we do?", "completion": "I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication."}
{"prompt": "You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?", "completion": "He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind."}
{"prompt": "Frank?", "completion": "Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination."}
{"prompt": "Come again?", "completion": "Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.", "completion": "Has your son ever told you about Frank?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...", "completion": "What I think is going on with your son."}
{"prompt": "He was a year ahead of us?", "completion": "He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?"}
{"prompt": "So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.", "completion": "You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound..."}
{"prompt": "Our son just called me a bitch.", "completion": "You're not a bitch."}
{"prompt": "Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...", "completion": "Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight."}
{"prompt": "It is a big deal.", "completion": "I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container."}
{"prompt": "How did you know --", "completion": "I didn't realise it was such a big deal."}
{"prompt": "You can suck a fuck.", "completion": "No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?"}
{"prompt": "Did you just call me a fuck-ass?", "completion": "That's enough."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me?", "completion": "Donnie? You're a dick."}
{"prompt": "I haven't been accepted yet, mother.", "completion": "If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed."}
{"prompt": "How did this happen?", "completion": "I guess they made him do it."}
{"prompt": "Christ. Is that an axe?", "completion": "Yep."}
{"prompt": "What else?", "completion": "What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else."}
{"prompt": "Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.", "completion": "I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main."}
{"prompt": "Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.", "completion": "Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York..."}
{"prompt": "Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.", "completion": "But now you can't go."}
{"prompt": "Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.", "completion": "Beg pardon?"}
{"prompt": "Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.", "completion": "Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon."}
{"prompt": "Rose.", "completion": "Kitty..."}
{"prompt": "Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.", "completion": "Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear."}
{"prompt": "Do you even know who Graham Greene is?", "completion": "I think we've all seen \"Bonanza\"."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.", "completion": "The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum."}
{"prompt": "This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...", "completion": "I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism."}
{"prompt": "The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.", "completion": "And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.", "completion": "Kitty..."}
{"prompt": "I stole four beers from my dad.", "completion": "Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait..."}
{"prompt": "Not Vanity. He's a homo.", "completion": "We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper."}
{"prompt": "Smurfette doesn't fuck.", "completion": "Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny."}
{"prompt": "Wicked.", "completion": "No more fuckin' for her."}
{"prompt": "What is this shit?", "completion": "Raspberry."}
{"prompt": "All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.", "completion": "Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work."}
{"prompt": "There's no rule!", "completion": "Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home."}
{"prompt": "Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.", "completion": "You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55."}
{"prompt": "Chut up!", "completion": "Go back to China, bitch!"}
{"prompt": "Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!", "completion": "I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer."}
{"prompt": "Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.", "completion": "I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. They're just starin'.", "completion": "I gotta work with these women."}
{"prompt": "I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...", "completion": "Loretta, don't do that."}
{"prompt": "All right, say \"Airport Ho-Jo.\"", "completion": "Airport Ho-Jo!"}
{"prompt": "Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...", "completion": "There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!"}
{"prompt": "What? For chrissakes, spit it out.", "completion": "I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!"}
{"prompt": "Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!", "completion": "It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a \"personal consultation\" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!"}
{"prompt": "I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.", "completion": "This came for you, sweetie."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.", "completion": "You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people."}
{"prompt": "...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...", "completion": "What is wrong with you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.", "completion": "Thank God for bunge cords."}
{"prompt": "Loretta, never have kids.", "completion": "Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could."}
{"prompt": "My mom wanted me to have this?", "completion": "Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep."}
{"prompt": "Really, Loretta?", "completion": "You-betcha."}
{"prompt": "Oh-yah.", "completion": "That was your mom. She wanted you to have this."}
{"prompt": "No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.", "completion": "\"Once a carnie, always a carnie.\""}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you betcha...", "completion": "Hell-no, she ain't quittin'."}
{"prompt": "Simple. Just say, \"Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'.\" There. Easy as pie.", "completion": "Oh my God. I'm so dead..."}
{"prompt": "Oh God, I'm dead...", "completion": "So, what do I say?"}
{"prompt": "I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.", "completion": "I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!"}
{"prompt": "Don't let that worry you, Annette!", "completion": "You're what?!"}
{"prompt": "She's right over there.", "completion": "Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!"}
{"prompt": "She's alive, sweetie.", "completion": "Where is she?!"}
{"prompt": "Oh-you-beccha.", "completion": "Is Mom okay?"}
{"prompt": "Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a \"skinny little fag\" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.", "completion": "Yah?"}
{"prompt": "Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.", "completion": "Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't."}
{"prompt": "Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one \"Liza\" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.", "completion": "Your parents'd kill you."}
{"prompt": "\"Here,\" wh-wh-what?", "completion": "My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...", "completion": "Amber? Here."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Amber...", "completion": "I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete."}
{"prompt": "Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.", "completion": "But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong..."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.", "completion": "Mrs. Leeman?"}
{"prompt": "No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.", "completion": "I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent."}
{"prompt": "You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.", "completion": "Relax, that's my ma's code for, \"Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys.\""}
{"prompt": "No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.", "completion": "I'm gonna need more caps."}
{"prompt": "-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.", "completion": "Amber..."}
{"prompt": "Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.", "completion": "Well, your \"cheap whore\" is this family's \"lovin' mother.\"  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and..."}
{"prompt": "We was robbed.", "completion": "It's okay."}
{"prompt": "I love you much.", "completion": "Bye mom."}

{"prompt": "Girls check in, but they don't check out.", "completion": "Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health."}
{"prompt": "Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.", "completion": "This pageant's like a roach motel."}
{"prompt": "...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.", "completion": "Tammy Curry?"}
{"prompt": "That's enough!", "completion": "Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!"}

{"prompt": "Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?", "completion": "Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them."}
{"prompt": "Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.", "completion": "Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!"}
{"prompt": "...Today's \"To Do\" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the \"Physical Fitness\" number --", "completion": "Nothin' too showy!"}

{"prompt": "Then you don't wanna work hard?", "completion": "I don't wanna work at all."}
{"prompt": "Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?", "completion": "That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy."}

Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --"}
{"prompt": "You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.", "completion": "That's what I get for dressing in a hurry."}

{"prompt": "Your Excellency!", "completion": "You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you."}
{"prompt": "Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.", "completion": "No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you."}
{"prompt": "The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.", "completion": "I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?"}
{"prompt": "In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.", "completion": "Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- \"D\" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?"}
{"prompt": "What'll I do with this card?", "completion": "You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, would you...?", "completion": "For you, I would do anything..."}
{"prompt": "This is terrible!", "completion": "Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency."}
{"prompt": "I didn't come here to be insulted.", "completion": "I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war."}
{"prompt": "Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?", "completion": "Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!"}
{"prompt": "Oh.  Then there his somebody else?", "completion": "Well no -- not exactly -- but --"}
{"prompt": "...but would further cement the relations of our countries.", "completion": "Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --"}
{"prompt": "Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.", "completion": "Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land."}
{"prompt": "Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --", "completion": "What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything."}
{"prompt": "If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...", "completion": "Perhaps he will listen to you..."}
{"prompt": "Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.", "completion": "Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --"}
{"prompt": "This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...", "completion": "I thought everything was working out fine."}
{"prompt": "My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.", "completion": "It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who..."}
{"prompt": "That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.", "completion": "Uncle, you can't do this!"}
{"prompt": "With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --", "completion": "Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly."}
{"prompt": "If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.", "completion": "So that's the one you want to marry."}
{"prompt": "She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.", "completion": "Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes.", "completion": "Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful."}
{"prompt": "They have noble faces.", "completion": "I've always thought that myself."}
{"prompt": "And here is one of Frederick's mother.", "completion": "How lovely."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.", "completion": "Oh?"}
{"prompt": "One or two?", "completion": "Two, please."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Merrick, sugar?", "completion": "Yes please, two."}
{"prompt": "...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?", "completion": "Oh Frederick."}
{"prompt": "But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?", "completion": "Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?"}
{"prompt": "That I am very little different from him.", "completion": "Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you."}
{"prompt": "Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.", "completion": "Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?"}
{"prompt": "Hmmm?", "completion": "...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening."}
{"prompt": "Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.", "completion": "More romances for John?"}
{"prompt": "And here are my mother and father.", "completion": "You stay with me."}
{"prompt": "Do you?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...", "completion": "John loves the house."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.", "completion": "Well, these things take time."}
{"prompt": "And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?", "completion": "I'm sure I don't know, Freddie."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?", "completion": "Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?"}
{"prompt": "He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?", "completion": "Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.", "completion": "But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?"}
{"prompt": "I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "No, I think a whiskey.", "completion": "Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged."}
{"prompt": "Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?", "completion": "Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?"}
{"prompt": "I'll join you shortly.", "completion": "Did it go well, darling?"}
{"prompt": "I'll get my bag.", "completion": "You won't be long?"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "Like this."}
{"prompt": "Did you see it?", "completion": "Our man is sick. Come right away."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "I found it."}
{"prompt": "Shut up!", "completion": "Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir."}
{"prompt": "I'll show you! I'll show you!", "completion": "Don't!"}
{"prompt": "If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.", "completion": "What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt": "He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!", "completion": "He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die."}
{"prompt": "You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!", "completion": "Aw, Bytes, he's sick."}
{"prompt": "Now I think we really do understand one another.", "completion": "Right... Right."}
{"prompt": "So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!", "completion": "I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!"}
{"prompt": "You don't own this man!", "completion": "I want him back!"}
{"prompt": "All you do is profit from another man's misery!", "completion": "You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back."}
{"prompt": "I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.", "completion": "He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!"}
{"prompt": "You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...", "completion": "Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!"}
{"prompt": "He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.", "completion": "DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!"}
{"prompt": "Just a moment, how did you get in here?", "completion": "Never mind that, I want my man!"}
{"prompt": "Everything will be seen to.", "completion": "I want my man back."}
{"prompt": "You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his \"fall\". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.", "completion": "I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?"}
{"prompt": "This man belongs in hospital.", "completion": "Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen."}
{"prompt": "Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.", "completion": "That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy."}
{"prompt": "He must have taken quite a fall.", "completion": "He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "He fell.  He falls."}
{"prompt": "He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.", "completion": "I intend to."}
{"prompt": "What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...", "completion": "Steady on, Treves. Have a seat."}
{"prompt": "Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.", "completion": "Please do."}
{"prompt": "Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.", "completion": "But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?", "completion": "Has the response picked up?"}
{"prompt": "Don't we?", "completion": "No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him."}
{"prompt": "Do you think they'll go along with us?", "completion": "Of course they will. They're reasonable men."}
{"prompt": "Well, yes.", "completion": "Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities."}
{"prompt": "I could easily arrange...", "completion": "No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?"}
{"prompt": "No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.", "completion": "You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick."}
{"prompt": "Can you imagine what his life has been like?", "completion": "Yes, I think I can."}
{"prompt": "Treves. Well done.", "completion": "Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness."}
{"prompt": "I don't understand.", "completion": "Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.", "completion": "How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it."}
{"prompt": "It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.", "completion": "Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes?", "completion": "And what was that, John?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.", "completion": "Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them."}
{"prompt": "...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.", "completion": "He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?"}
{"prompt": "It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.", "completion": "Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?"}
{"prompt": "Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.", "completion": "...Yes, Sir."}
{"prompt": "Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?", "completion": "Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir."}
{"prompt": "Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.", "completion": "Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?"}
{"prompt": "Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.", "completion": "Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.", "completion": "No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say \"Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,\" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."}
{"prompt": "Well sir, perhaps I should explain...", "completion": "I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are."}
{"prompt": "He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.", "completion": "A few words? I thought he was imbecile?"}
{"prompt": "Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.", "completion": "Good! How is the patient?"}
{"prompt": "Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?", "completion": "Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?"}
{"prompt": "No, more of an acquaintance.", "completion": "I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.", "completion": "Oh, is he a friend of yours?"}
{"prompt": "Yes sir.", "completion": "What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point."}
{"prompt": "Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.", "completion": "Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?"}
{"prompt": "No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.", "completion": "Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?"}
{"prompt": "Indeed!", "completion": "A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.", "completion": "Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you."}
{"prompt": "You've acquired a taste for this?", "completion": "It's quite nutritious, sir."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Treves.", "completion": "Good morning, sir."}
{"prompt": "I am very pleased to meet you.", "completion": "I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day."}
{"prompt": "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...", "completion": "It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick."}
{"prompt": "Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.", "completion": "What is it, Treves?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?", "completion": "...everyone has been very kind."}
{"prompt": "Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.", "completion": "...I... everyone has been very kind to me."}
{"prompt": "I feel much better. Thank you.", "completion": "Are you comfortable here?"}
{"prompt": "I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?", "completion": "I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?"}
{"prompt": "He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.", "completion": "How are you feeling today?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing of any importance, eh?", "completion": "You never mentioned his mental state."}
{"prompt": "Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.", "completion": "I don't know what I've got."}
{"prompt": "Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?", "completion": "You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself."}
{"prompt": "I say Freddie, what are you about?", "completion": "Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance."}
{"prompt": "Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.", "completion": "What a mess."}
{"prompt": "Three quarters of an hour.", "completion": "Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this."}
{"prompt": "I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say \"I love you\". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.", "completion": "How long has this man been here?"}
{"prompt": "What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?", "completion": "Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits."}
{"prompt": "An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.", "completion": "O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies."}
{"prompt": "O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?", "completion": "Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is \"like me\"."}
{"prompt": "Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?", "completion": "Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England."}
{"prompt": "Oh no?", "completion": "Oh no... no... you're a Romeo."}
{"prompt": "O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.", "completion": "Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all..."}
{"prompt": "Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?", "completion": "Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."}
{"prompt": "Have you read it?", "completion": "No, but I certainly shall."}
{"prompt": "Romance!", "completion": "That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you..."}
{"prompt": "Tell me about it, please!", "completion": "It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance."}
{"prompt": "Alas, no.", "completion": "Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial."}
{"prompt": "Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?", "completion": "You've never been?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?", "completion": "Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there."}
{"prompt": "She's very pretty, your mother.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.", "completion": "Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no.", "completion": "I knew you'd understand. Here."}
{"prompt": "Good day...!", "completion": "I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Is he... dying then?", "completion": "Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do."}
{"prompt": "How awful for John.", "completion": "And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain."}
{"prompt": "Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.", "completion": "I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain."}
{"prompt": "It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.", "completion": "I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited."}
{"prompt": "John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.", "completion": "Good day, Mr. Merrick."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes.", "completion": "You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction."}
{"prompt": "Oh no, my friend...", "completion": "Say hello to London for me. I miss her."}
{"prompt": "Won't be a moment.", "completion": "I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had."}
{"prompt": "Of course! You want out?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Want to come out?", "completion": "You're English."}
{"prompt": "You alright?", "completion": "y-y-yes--"}
{"prompt": "I'll have to find some more.", "completion": "Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick."}
{"prompt": "The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?", "completion": "...I learned a long time ago."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "The main spire."}
{"prompt": "I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.", "completion": "It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all."}
{"prompt": "Where did you get this box?", "completion": "The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!"}
{"prompt": "But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.", "completion": "Thank you... very much."}
{"prompt": "What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Mr. Merrick.", "completion": "Good morning."}
{"prompt": "Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.", "completion": "No, nothing."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "You too, my friend. Goodnight.", "completion": "Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?"}
{"prompt": "No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.", "completion": "Goodnight John. Sleep well."}
{"prompt": "No, John, not one that I can see.", "completion": "Then I shouldn't change anything?"}
{"prompt": "Yes John?", "completion": "Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes! It was wonderful!", "completion": "I'm glad, John. Goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Yes, very soon.", "completion": "Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening."}
{"prompt": "It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.", "completion": "Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?"}
{"prompt": "Stand up, John. Let them see you.", "completion": "Oh no, I couldn't."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Treves! Treves.", "completion": "John.... how can you ever forgive me?"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure? Because I can take it back.", "completion": "Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends."}
{"prompt": "Is it the one you wanted?", "completion": "Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves."}
{"prompt": "My home.", "completion": "There is one more thing, John. Here."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness."}
{"prompt": "Yes, John.", "completion": "You did this for me?"}
{"prompt": "You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?", "completion": "...my... home?"}
{"prompt": "Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?", "completion": "You want a dressing bag, John?"}
{"prompt": "How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?", "completion": "Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you."}
{"prompt": "The cathedral is coming along nicely.", "completion": "Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!"}
{"prompt": "No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.", "completion": "I thought as much."}
{"prompt": "Yes, John?", "completion": "...Can you cure me?"}
{"prompt": "Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.", "completion": "Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time..."}
{"prompt": "John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?", "completion": "When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?"}
{"prompt": "Good morning, John.", "completion": "Good morning."}
{"prompt": "Your mother?", "completion": "Here."}
{"prompt": "Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.", "completion": "Would you... would you like to see my mother?"}
{"prompt": "The Children. Where are your children", "completion": "Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends."}
{"prompt": "The children! May I see?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Who are they of?", "completion": "Oh, our relatives... the children."}
{"prompt": "I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?", "completion": "Oh yes."}
{"prompt": "It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.", "completion": "Not at all, John."}
{"prompt": "Ohhh...", "completion": "How is your tea, John?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?", "completion": "That's a canopy, John."}
{"prompt": "John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?", "completion": "I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much.", "completion": "When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best."}
{"prompt": "I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?", "completion": "You look splendid, John."}
{"prompt": "Of course! What did you think?", "completion": "How long will I stay here?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "The hospital?"}
{"prompt": "Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.", "completion": "This... is my new home?"}
{"prompt": "Good evening. How are you feeling?", "completion": "Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.", "completion": "We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?"}
{"prompt": "You did not ask me.", "completion": "I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?"}
{"prompt": "But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.", "completion": "Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.", "completion": "...Yes potatoes... but..."}
{"prompt": "Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.", "completion": "Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?"}
{"prompt": "Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!", "completion": "John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm."}
{"prompt": "Righteousness for his namesake.", "completion": "Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say \"May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm.\" And you will say..."}
{"prompt": "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...", "completion": "Righteousness..."}
{"prompt": "Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?", "completion": "Hello, my name is John Merrick."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...", "completion": "Hello... my name is... John Merrick."}
{"prompt": "Say \"Mmmerrick.\"", "completion": "Mmmerrick."}
{"prompt": "Say \"Mmmerrick.\"", "completion": "Mmmerrick."}
{"prompt": "Say \"Merrick\".", "completion": "Merrick..."}
{"prompt": "John Merrick.", "completion": "John... Merrick"}
{"prompt": "My name is...", "completion": "My... name is..."}
{"prompt": "Excellent! Now, say... \"Hello\"", "completion": "Hello..."}
{"prompt": "Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "That's much better. I could understand that \"yes\".", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "Yyyess.", "completion": "Yyess."}
{"prompt": "Yes John!", "completion": "...Yyes"}
{"prompt": "Welcome home, John.", "completion": "Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess."}
{"prompt": "John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.", "completion": "So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here."}
{"prompt": "You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.", "completion": "Well..."}
{"prompt": "Yes. John wants it.", "completion": "A dressing bag?"}
{"prompt": "A dressing bag.", "completion": "Very smart indeed."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.", "completion": "Yes sir.  What's that?"}
{"prompt": "You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.", "completion": "Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick."}
{"prompt": "Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.", "completion": "I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it."}
{"prompt": "Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...", "completion": "But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends."}
{"prompt": "Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.", "completion": "I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir."}
{"prompt": "Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.", "completion": "Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you."}
{"prompt": "Watery headed bunch.", "completion": "I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity."}
{"prompt": "Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.", "completion": "I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?"}
{"prompt": "Good Lord, Mr. Treves!", "completion": "We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him."}
{"prompt": "He's had his share of \"smacks\", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.", "completion": "Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir."}
{"prompt": "No, he's very upset about something.", "completion": "Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it."}
{"prompt": "Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.", "completion": "Won't come out, eh?"}
{"prompt": "Yes! The workhouse!", "completion": "Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?"}
{"prompt": "Yes... Yes, let's go in.", "completion": "The workhouse."}
{"prompt": "Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...", "completion": "Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?"}
{"prompt": "Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.", "completion": "I've heard."}
{"prompt": "Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?", "completion": "Fine."}
{"prompt": "YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.", "completion": "YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!"}
{"prompt": "When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.", "completion": "YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?"}
{"prompt": "Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.", "completion": "HE'S GONE!"}
{"prompt": "I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.", "completion": "Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?"}
{"prompt": "I'll send a cab. Here is my card.", "completion": "WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?"}
{"prompt": "So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?", "completion": "Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there."}
{"prompt": "Pardon me?", "completion": "Never mind. I'm the owner."}
{"prompt": "I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?", "completion": "Handsomely?... Who sent you?"}
{"prompt": "Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.", "completion": "I don't think so. No sir, we're closed."}
{"prompt": "Are you the proprietor?", "completion": "And who might you be, sir?"}
{"prompt": "It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!", "completion": "Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you..."}
{"prompt": "It's all right! It isn't happening!", "completion": "But, Father, it IS!"}
{"prompt": "It's your fantasy...", "completion": "But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her..."}
{"prompt": "There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...", "completion": "She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day."}
{"prompt": "It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....", "completion": "I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic..."}
{"prompt": "Ah! So you admit there IS someone!", "completion": "You're losing your temper!"}
{"prompt": "Well... where is he?", "completion": "There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!", "completion": "There IS no one."}
{"prompt": "Right! Where is he?", "completion": "Who, Father?"}
{"prompt": "Ah! It's my father!", "completion": "Open up! I know you're in there!"}
{"prompt": "But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...", "completion": "Open up! I know you're in there!"}
{"prompt": "No... no...", "completion": "I don't want to live WITHOUT you."}
{"prompt": "No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.", "completion": "Then I shall come too."}
{"prompt": "Blow the third note! The note to take us home!", "completion": "There is something I must ask the Gods..."}
{"prompt": "Erik! You've done what you came to do!", "completion": "Not quite..."}
{"prompt": "The second note.", "completion": "The second note to wake the Gods..."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- I believe you do.", "completion": "Then let go!"}
{"prompt": "I... but I...", "completion": "You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?"}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Do you believe I love you?"}
{"prompt": "I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!", "completion": "YOU still want to go to Asgaard?"}
{"prompt": "That's right!", "completion": "No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength."}
{"prompt": "No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!", "completion": "No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us."}
{"prompt": "Goodbye, Aud...", "completion": "And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!"}
{"prompt": "No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.", "completion": "But you don't realize...."}
{"prompt": "I'll bring it back.", "completion": "Erik. You don't understand."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "I mean, you could have killed yourself.", "completion": "Where's the Cloak Invisible?"}
{"prompt": "But, Erik...", "completion": "Just give me a hand."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Halfdan the Black."}
{"prompt": "And the week before that?", "completion": "We mustn't let him land!"}
{"prompt": "Five this week; how many the week before?", "completion": "You're as bad as my father."}
{"prompt": "And I thought you said it was something special...", "completion": "That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE..."}
{"prompt": "\"The fifth one this week\"!", "completion": "Oh, for goodness' sake!"}
{"prompt": "I've never been to bed with anybody!", "completion": "The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift."}
{"prompt": "You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?", "completion": "I've never LOVED anybody!"}
{"prompt": "We never went to bed together.", "completion": "Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?"}
{"prompt": "Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...", "completion": "But you LOVED her all the same..."}
{"prompt": "It was different...", "completion": "What was she like?"}
{"prompt": "HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?", "completion": "What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before..."}
{"prompt": "You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?", "completion": "No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?"}
{"prompt": "What... you mean \"got into bed with\" them?", "completion": "No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?"}
{"prompt": "But surely you know...?", "completion": "Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?"}
{"prompt": "WHY?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter?", "completion": "PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!"}
{"prompt": "Those things in your hands.", "completion": "These? What are THESE? They're swords."}
{"prompt": "Please! Please! What are those?", "completion": "What are what?"}
{"prompt": "How d'you KNOW we're \"friends\"?", "completion": "Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil."}
{"prompt": "WELCOME?", "completion": "Well, of course. We always welcome friends."}
{"prompt": "WHAT did you say?", "completion": "I said welcome."}
{"prompt": "We blew the Horn Resounding.", "completion": "SHE blew the Horn Resounding."}
{"prompt": "What d'you mean?", "completion": "How do we know this is the way?"}
{"prompt": "It was my master Keitel's idea.", "completion": "But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?"}
{"prompt": "Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.", "completion": "But --"}
{"prompt": "That I cannot tell you.", "completion": "LOKI! Where did YOU come from?"}
{"prompt": "I will go and wake them up!", "completion": "And will the dead ever return, Freya?"}
{"prompt": "Is there nothing men can do?", "completion": "The Gods are asleep, Erik."}
{"prompt": "Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...", "completion": "The sky WAS blue, Erik... once."}
{"prompt": "The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.", "completion": "But have you ever seen it? Think back..."}
{"prompt": "Is it summer or winter, Erik?", "completion": "Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?"}
{"prompt": "Is it night or day, Erik?", "completion": "It is day, of course, Freya."}
{"prompt": "What do you see, Erik?", "completion": "I see the world."}
{"prompt": "I shouldn't have come.", "completion": "They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?"}
{"prompt": "The important thing is not to panic.", "completion": "Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the \"Viking\"?"}
{"prompt": "Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.", "completion": "But it IS! Look!"}
{"prompt": "Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?", "completion": "Yes... oh, yes..."}
{"prompt": "Is there something the matter with it?", "completion": "Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big."}
{"prompt": "You don't know Halfdan the Black.", "completion": "I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand."}
{"prompt": "He wants to kill US!", "completion": "Not when we explain about the Great Blessing."}
{"prompt": "Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!", "completion": "Don't talk nonsense."}
{"prompt": "He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...", "completion": "They'll be more than \"hurt\" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"}
{"prompt": "Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.", "completion": "You've got to let me go!"}
{"prompt": "I'll tell you what...", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.", "completion": "YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing..."}
{"prompt": "Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...", "completion": "Well, how d'you think I feel?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!"}
{"prompt": "No, no... It was very... er, nice.", "completion": "Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?"}
{"prompt": "Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes \"TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM\"", "completion": "We're just not a very musical nation..."}
{"prompt": "And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "REALLY?", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "You're just saying that.", "completion": "Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing."}
{"prompt": "No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?", "completion": "Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure it's lovely.", "completion": "But you don't want to hear it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...", "completion": "A lot of people like our singing."}
{"prompt": "Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --", "completion": "You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?"}
{"prompt": "That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...", "completion": "What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?"}
{"prompt": "Well... isn't it great?", "completion": "Would you like us to sing to you?"}
{"prompt": "Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...", "completion": "Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing."}
{"prompt": "The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know! I just did!", "completion": "No... we don't..."}
{"prompt": "Odin!", "completion": "Why should you care?"}
{"prompt": "Is THAT Odin?", "completion": "You'll have to wait till he's finished his game."}
{"prompt": "Have you tried to ask the God for anything?", "completion": "Well... no..."}
{"prompt": "What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?", "completion": "I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!"}
{"prompt": "What a stupid idea.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me your name?", "completion": "I've come to take you back to the land of the living."}
{"prompt": "Why should you care?", "completion": "Why... should YOU care?"}
{"prompt": "You told them I raped you -- why?", "completion": "I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable..."}
{"prompt": "I didn't mean to!", "completion": "Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, thanks.", "completion": "Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death."}
{"prompt": "Louder.", "completion": "Aaagh! Rape!"}
{"prompt": "Scream.", "completion": "Ah."}
{"prompt": "I just said I didn't feel like raping you.", "completion": "And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on."}
{"prompt": "Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!", "completion": "Well you started it."}
{"prompt": "To pay for the next expedition, of course.", "completion": "But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out."}
{"prompt": "Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.", "completion": "Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?"}
{"prompt": "Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.", "completion": "What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "About NOT raping you...", "completion": "You DON'T like it, do you?"}
{"prompt": "I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.", "completion": "About raping me?"}
{"prompt": "I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?", "completion": "What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me..."}
{"prompt": "I don't suppose... no...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "No. It isn't rape then, is it?", "completion": "Oh, get it over with."}
{"prompt": "No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...", "completion": "What -- rape?"}
{"prompt": "Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.", "completion": "You don't love ME."}
{"prompt": "It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.", "completion": "Sh!"}
{"prompt": "What about the raping?", "completion": "Shut up."}
{"prompt": "Looting and pillaging, eh?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Have you done this sort of thing before?", "completion": "Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast."}
{"prompt": "It's not magic! It's just a trick!", "completion": "Don't you FEEL it?"}
{"prompt": "But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!", "completion": "I know. I know."}
{"prompt": "I know!", "completion": "He wants to KILL us."}
{"prompt": "You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?", "completion": "Halfdan the Black's here!"}
{"prompt": "You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make \"friends\".", "completion": "That's terrible!"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "What's wrong with making friends?"}
{"prompt": "Very deep... usually...", "completion": "Let's hack her to pieces."}
{"prompt": "It saved my father!", "completion": "How deep IS the ocean?"}
{"prompt": "I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!", "completion": "Erik! Row! What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Come on, move it!", "completion": "It's Halfdan the Black!"}
{"prompt": "He was lucky...  Sit there.", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night."}
{"prompt": "\"But\" what?", "completion": "But..."}
{"prompt": "FIND the Rainbow Bridge?", "completion": "Find it... AND cross it!"}
{"prompt": "I... I... KILLED her...", "completion": "That's my boy!"}
{"prompt": "She got me thinking...", "completion": "So? What'd you do to her?"}
{"prompt": "I met this girl...", "completion": "It's always the women that start the trouble."}
{"prompt": "Where does it all get us, Grandpa?", "completion": "Who have you been talking to?"}
{"prompt": "We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...", "completion": "You talking piffle, son?"}
{"prompt": "What's it all about?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Make your mind up.", "completion": "We're missing all the fun..."}
{"prompt": "Sorry!", "completion": "Faster!"}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "Slower! In... Out..."}
{"prompt": "Row! Row! Row!", "completion": "Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!"}
{"prompt": "Well, you ARE!", "completion": "I want to die...  No, I don't!"}
{"prompt": "Look out!", "completion": "He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway."}
{"prompt": "You'll see!", "completion": "What did he say?"}
{"prompt": "I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.", "completion": "What \"magic\" have you brought, Erik?"}
{"prompt": "It's magic.", "completion": "What \"magic\"?"}
{"prompt": "Look, the sky is blue...", "completion": "The sun! That's it!"}
{"prompt": "SHUT UP!", "completion": "ROW!"}
{"prompt": "Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.", "completion": "Shut up. You there. You there and you there."}
{"prompt": "What are YOU doing here?", "completion": "You may need a real Berserk."}
{"prompt": "But you're the Gods!", "completion": "Look... Erik..."}
{"prompt": "Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.", "completion": "Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other."}
{"prompt": "Because... you're... you're the Gods....", "completion": "So?"}
{"prompt": "Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.", "completion": "Why should WE care?"}
{"prompt": "You must help us.", "completion": "We don't HAVE to help anybody."}
{"prompt": "You'll be sucked down too!", "completion": "No! Arrgh!"}
{"prompt": "No! Let go, Snorri!", "completion": "I've got you!"}
{"prompt": "Weren't we supposed to?", "completion": "Oh... I feel a little... oh..."}
{"prompt": "A magic dishcloth.", "completion": "To the oars!"}
{"prompt": "Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.", "completion": "Like fish."}
{"prompt": "First we're flying -- now we're sinking!", "completion": "Well, come on!"}
{"prompt": "Row!", "completion": "Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?"}
{"prompt": "That's better.", "completion": "Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other."}
{"prompt": "That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.", "completion": "Now you've got all the big ones on one side."}
{"prompt": "Trust me to get the missionary.", "completion": "You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time."}
{"prompt": "It's SO nice to feel wanted.", "completion": "Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there..."}
{"prompt": "Thank you VERY much indeed.", "completion": "Now stop it!"}
{"prompt": "You mean we'd be dead?", "completion": "No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods."}
{"prompt": "Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...", "completion": "No, don't say anything else!"}
{"prompt": "Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!", "completion": "I think we should go..."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with them?", "completion": "Just say something cheerful."}
{"prompt": "You need to say a bit more than that!", "completion": "Oh... er... yes..."}
{"prompt": "Who gets killed?", "completion": "Nobody gets killed."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "There is another way."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!"}
{"prompt": "How about making friends?", "completion": "So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!"}
{"prompt": "But...", "completion": "Well, what else do we do?"}
{"prompt": "But how could he know... unless...", "completion": "And you, Keitel Blacksmith."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with Bjorn?", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Keitel Blacksmith?", "completion": "Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place."}
{"prompt": "I have to go...", "completion": "Wait, Erik!"}
{"prompt": "Let me do something for myself for a change!", "completion": "I came to find my grandfather."}
{"prompt": "Over the Edge of the World.", "completion": "Sven!"}
{"prompt": "Is THIS Hy-Brasil?", "completion": "We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard..."}
{"prompt": "She MUST have a knife or something...", "completion": "Hy-Brasil?"}
{"prompt": "DEATH!", "completion": "She hasn't got any."}
{"prompt": "We haven't got a spare place.", "completion": "ROW!"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.", "completion": "I AM one, Dad!"}
{"prompt": "Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.", "completion": "Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?"}
{"prompt": "Look, I bagged it last week.", "completion": "It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, you two! What's going on?", "completion": "I was sitting there."}
{"prompt": "But HOW?", "completion": "I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try."}
{"prompt": "Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.", "completion": "We'd be the first!"}
{"prompt": "Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.", "completion": "What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?"}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about, Erik?", "completion": "What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?"}
{"prompt": "And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?", "completion": "I will join my grandfather there."}
{"prompt": "That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.", "completion": "Please."}
{"prompt": "You will wait?", "completion": "What d'you expect me to do?"}
{"prompt": "Bye... sorry...", "completion": "Yeah... well..."}
{"prompt": "Well, where is he then?", "completion": "Bye, Leif."}
{"prompt": "Vanish into thin air?", "completion": "He hasn't."}
{"prompt": "How did he do that?", "completion": "Do what?"}
{"prompt": "What do we have to do?", "completion": "Nothing... I just immerse you in water..."}
{"prompt": "The Dragon...", "completion": "It can't do you any HARM..."}
{"prompt": "I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.", "completion": "What's all the panic about?"}
{"prompt": "Your lord.", "completion": "Quite... MY lord... said: \"The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick.\""}
{"prompt": "No, it is NOT.", "completion": "You know, my son, our lord said..."}
{"prompt": "Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.", "completion": "Same thing, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...", "completion": "There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER."}
{"prompt": "I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.", "completion": "You're wasting your time."}
{"prompt": "Mum! Dad!", "completion": "You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!", "completion": "Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!"}
{"prompt": "And a sort of slightly sick feeling?", "completion": "That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory."}
{"prompt": "Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?", "completion": "That's it!"}
{"prompt": "He used to puke in his sleep.", "completion": "Bastard."}
{"prompt": "Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.", "completion": "Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL."}
{"prompt": "I mean many of the greatest sailors were.", "completion": "I know. I know."}
{"prompt": "You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.", "completion": "How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?"}
{"prompt": "Are you all right?", "completion": "No, I'm not."}
{"prompt": "For your own sake... For the others... I...", "completion": "Hang on..."}
{"prompt": "I'm not worth risking your life for.", "completion": "I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too..."}
{"prompt": "Let me go, Sven.", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "Aaagh!", "completion": "Got you!"}
{"prompt": "Get away, Snorri.", "completion": "What have you got there?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?"}
{"prompt": "It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...", "completion": "Oh..."}
{"prompt": "I... I...", "completion": "Who's that?"}
{"prompt": "It's not my business any more!", "completion": "Well! Come on!"}

{"prompt": "Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...", "completion": "Yes yes... of course.... the \"Blacksmith's Code\"..."}
{"prompt": "You could charge him what you like.", "completion": "You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it."}
{"prompt": "Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.", "completion": "Yes, it is good. But I told him ten."}
{"prompt": "Dad!", "completion": "I hate you! I hate you!"}
{"prompt": "Easy, Dad!", "completion": "And his \"you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper\"..."}

{"prompt": "I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!", "completion": "We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!"}
{"prompt": "I must only let the red rage...", "completion": "You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle."}
{"prompt": "But it's a responsibility...", "completion": "But it's a responsibility being a Berserk."}
{"prompt": "So did your father...", "completion": "So did my father and his father before him."}

{"prompt": "I remember.", "completion": "This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit."}
{"prompt": "I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.", "completion": "I did. You said, things were fine."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.", "completion": "Just a little overworked, maybe."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Say hi to Naomi."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, guys.", "completion": "I hope you feel better, sweetie."}
{"prompt": "They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.", "completion": "Sweetie, we called the company."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!", "completion": "You weren't supposed to see that."}
{"prompt": "She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.", "completion": "Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?", "completion": "I don't know, honey. It's horrible."}
{"prompt": "You did? You liked me?", "completion": "No, it was lovely."}
{"prompt": "But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?", "completion": "And I just liked you so much."}
{"prompt": "Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...", "completion": "But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it."}
{"prompt": "Here we are.", "completion": "Shit. The last time I saw you."}
{"prompt": "How are you today?", "completion": "Okay, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Ms. Kruczynski?", "completion": "Hi."}

{"prompt": "Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.", "completion": "May I help you?"}
{"prompt": "It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.", "completion": "What's wrong with me?"}
{"prompt": "I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.", "completion": "I didn't have a chance to wrap it."}

{"prompt": "Oh, Tangerine.", "completion": "Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense."}
{"prompt": "Oh, baby, what's going on?", "completion": "I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me."}

{"prompt": "I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.", "completion": "It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room."}
{"prompt": "I can't. I want to, but I have to study.", "completion": "You rat."}
{"prompt": "I was not.", "completion": "Come over after I'm done here?"}

{"prompt": "Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?", "completion": "I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there."}
{"prompt": "You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?", "completion": "What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay."}
{"prompt": "Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?", "completion": "Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess."}
{"prompt": "How are you today?", "completion": "Okay, I guess."}
{"prompt": "What old mill? Is that somewhere we --", "completion": "I just wanted to say that. Come by my house."}
{"prompt": "I can't stop thinking about you.", "completion": "Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill."}
{"prompt": "We should have sex. It's old hat for us.", "completion": "You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my \"gratuitous need to shock.\""}
{"prompt": "Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?", "completion": "I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't sound like me.", "completion": "Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake."}
{"prompt": "Did I use the term \"sexual conquests\" or is that your way of putting it.", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.", "completion": "Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests."}
{"prompt": "A bully? Moi?", "completion": "That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid."}

{"prompt": "Joel, come here. Please.", "completion": "Listen, did you want to make love?"}
{"prompt": "What if?", "completion": "I think I should go back."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "I don't know. What if it breaks?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year."}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow?", "completion": "Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "When?"}
{"prompt": "I love you.", "completion": "So you'll call me, right?"}
{"prompt": "Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.", "completion": "Bye, Joel."}
{"prompt": "What if you stay this time?", "completion": "I walked out the door. There's no more memory."}
{"prompt": "So go.", "completion": "I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, \"so go\" with such disdain."}
{"prompt": "I think we should go.", "completion": "No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment."}
{"prompt": "Naomi.", "completion": "Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet."}
{"prompt": "It's dark.", "completion": "Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?"}
{"prompt": "I knew.", "completion": "I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass."}
{"prompt": "I hesitated for what seemed like forever.", "completion": "I could see you wanted to come in, Joel."}
{"prompt": "It's freezing out here.", "completion": "C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off."}
{"prompt": "Cool.", "completion": "What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Female.", "completion": "At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Male or female?"}
{"prompt": "Let's move into this neighborhood.", "completion": "I do sort of live with somebody though."}
{"prompt": "I wish we did. You married?", "completion": "Um, no."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah. It goes \"Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines\"?", "completion": "Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, maybe.", "completion": "Do you know her poem that starts \"Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."}
{"prompt": "I think, before.", "completion": "Seems too coincidental that way."}
{"prompt": "Me too. There's this poem --", "completion": "Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?"}
{"prompt": "Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.", "completion": "I think she's great."}
{"prompt": "Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?", "completion": "I love her."}
{"prompt": "I'll give you a couple. See what you think.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.", "completion": "yeah?"}
{"prompt": "But my sleeping is really fucked up.", "completion": "I don't think I've slept in a year."}
{"prompt": "No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.", "completion": "I know what you mean. That's why I stopped."}
{"prompt": "What do we do?", "completion": "Enjoy it. Say good-bye."}
{"prompt": "This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, like that.", "completion": "Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic."}
{"prompt": "I'm Joel.", "completion": "You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?"}
{"prompt": "And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.", "completion": "Oh God, how horrid."}
{"prompt": "You said --", "completion": "I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?"}
{"prompt": "You know what I did.", "completion": "Yeah, I know. I'm fishing."}
{"prompt": "I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.", "completion": "Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?"}
{"prompt": "I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.", "completion": "Yeah. I don't ever know what to say."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "You said..."}
{"prompt": "Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.", "completion": "Hi there."}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "It would be different, if we could just give it another go around."}
{"prompt": "Probably.", "completion": "I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that."}
{"prompt": "I had you pegged, didn't I?", "completion": "You had the whole human race pegged."}
{"prompt": "Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.", "completion": "I remember that speech really well."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again."}
{"prompt": "Not yet. Not married.", "completion": "Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to... take you out or something.", "completion": "Well, you're married."}
{"prompt": "Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "I did it. I guess that means something.", "completion": "I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all."}
{"prompt": "I told her today I need to end it.", "completion": "Is that what you want?"}
{"prompt": "It's very late.", "completion": "Yes, exactly. Exactly my point."}
{"prompt": "I dropped you off after. You said --", "completion": "Come up and see me... now."}
{"prompt": "So what. Infatuation is good, too.", "completion": "And I didn't have an argument."}
{"prompt": "I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.", "completion": "I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:"}
{"prompt": "I'm sure, I said.", "completion": "But you weren't. I could tell."}
{"prompt": "We did talk about Naomi.", "completion": "I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure."}
{"prompt": "Right. Something black though.", "completion": "I'll buy that. Black's always good."}
{"prompt": "Egad, were you horrified?", "completion": "No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons."}
{"prompt": "What was I wearing?", "completion": "God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper."}
{"prompt": "Naomi, I guess.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "This is our first \"date\" date.", "completion": "Do you remember what we talked about?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I want to enjoy my little time left with you."}
{"prompt": "I love it!", "completion": "I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!", "completion": "I scoured the city for it."}
{"prompt": "I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --", "completion": "Happy Birthday."}
{"prompt": "This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.", "completion": "Joel!"}
{"prompt": "Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?", "completion": "Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.", "completion": "They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now."}
{"prompt": "But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.", "completion": "Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally."}
{"prompt": "He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!", "completion": "Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now."}
{"prompt": "There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.", "completion": "Really? Is he cute?"}
{"prompt": "There's this guy!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --", "completion": "-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?"}
{"prompt": "I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.", "completion": "You remember what happened next?"}
{"prompt": "Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.", "completion": "You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over."}
{"prompt": "I'm right here.", "completion": "I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose..."}
{"prompt": "Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.", "completion": "I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem."}
{"prompt": "What if you hide me?", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Oh?", "completion": "I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore."}
{"prompt": "Such a beautiful view.", "completion": "Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, \"It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\""}

{"prompt": "No. Thanks.", "completion": "Joely..."}
{"prompt": "Joel, you're a liar.", "completion": "More?"}
{"prompt": "I want to know you.", "completion": "I just don't have anything very interesting about my life."}

{"prompt": "So, um --", "completion": "Would you get me another, Joely?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank God. It's going.", "completion": "It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!"}
{"prompt": "Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --", "completion": "I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!"}
{"prompt": "Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!", "completion": "You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "I don't want to talk about this here."}
{"prompt": "You're not ready.", "completion": "Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?"}
{"prompt": "No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.", "completion": "I don't think we're ready."}
{"prompt": "I want to have a baby.", "completion": "Let's talk about it later."}
{"prompt": "I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.", "completion": "Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?"}
{"prompt": "How can you watch this crap?", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.", "completion": "Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy."}
{"prompt": "No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?", "completion": "Let me drive you home."}
{"prompt": "Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.", "completion": "A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?"}
{"prompt": "Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.", "completion": "I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.", "completion": "...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic."}
{"prompt": "Yo ho ho!", "completion": "It's three."}
{"prompt": "How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?", "completion": "You didn't say anything about my hair."}
{"prompt": "Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.", "completion": "Okay."}

{"prompt": "You'll call me, right?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "So, I enjoyed meeting you."}

{"prompt": "I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --", "completion": "Sounds good. But right now I should go."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Yeah? Oh, great!"}
{"prompt": "I think so.", "completion": "I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime."}
{"prompt": "That's scary sounding.", "completion": "Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah.", "completion": "That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year."}
{"prompt": "I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...", "completion": "Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph."}
{"prompt": "I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?", "completion": "No, not at all."}
{"prompt": "You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?", "completion": "Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --"}
{"prompt": "And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.", "completion": "I do have a tendency to use that word too much."}
{"prompt": "Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.", "completion": "I think about that."}
{"prompt": "It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?", "completion": "Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess.", "completion": "But I think I am. I like to think I am."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.", "completion": "Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?"}
{"prompt": "Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.", "completion": "Y'know, I'm sort of psychic."}

{"prompt": "No, I'm okay for now.", "completion": "What do you want to hear?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.", "completion": "Ready for another?"}
{"prompt": "God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.", "completion": "I'm fine."}
{"prompt": "I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!", "completion": "Cheers."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?", "completion": "It's pretty."}
{"prompt": "Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.", "completion": "Frost?"}

{"prompt": "I'm not a stalker.", "completion": "You know Wilmont?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.", "completion": "You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that."}

{"prompt": "That's okay.", "completion": "My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, \"that's okay\" to me. That was nice of you."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today."}

{"prompt": "You sure? That doesn't sound --", "completion": "I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?"}

{"prompt": "I can't remember.", "completion": "Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole."}

You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now."}

{"prompt": "So you're still on the Zoloft?", "completion": "Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf."}
{"prompt": "I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.", "completion": "But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye."}
{"prompt": "This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.", "completion": "Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt."}
{"prompt": "On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.", "completion": "Okay. I wish you could come."}

{"prompt": "Any messages, Carmen?", "completion": "Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said..."}
{"prompt": "So then she just stops calling.", "completion": "I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was."}
{"prompt": "Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!", "completion": "Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!"}
{"prompt": "Clementine.", "completion": "That's your look for me."}
{"prompt": "I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...", "completion": "Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and..."}
{"prompt": "I should maybe talk to you.", "completion": "Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her."}

It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.", "completion": "Fuck you, Clementine."}

The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People.

There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.", "completion": "Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve."}
{"prompt": "Easy come, easy go.", "completion": "Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard."}
{"prompt": "You mean she's dead?", "completion": "But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte."}
{"prompt": "I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?", "completion": "She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City."}
{"prompt": "Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.", "completion": "The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!"}
{"prompt": "Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.", "completion": "Is everything getting worse?"}
{"prompt": "The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled \"Indians\" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that \"Indians\" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.", "completion": "What do you believe in then?"}
{"prompt": "During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.", "completion": "Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?"}
{"prompt": "But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.", "completion": "The Clock People?"}
{"prompt": "Siwash, huh?", "completion": "He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own."}
{"prompt": "Clockworks?", "completion": "The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People."}
{"prompt": "What was that?", "completion": "Clockworks."}
{"prompt": "But I don't know how to polka.", "completion": "Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee."}
{"prompt": "Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...", "completion": "Save your breath for the climb."}
{"prompt": "I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.", "completion": "I know who you are."}
{"prompt": "Where are the others?", "completion": "Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home."}
{"prompt": "A traveler, eh?", "completion": "You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling."}
{"prompt": "You don't?", "completion": "Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving."}
{"prompt": "I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?", "completion": "I don't."}
{"prompt": "Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?", "completion": "I'm staying with the Countess."}
{"prompt": "Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.", "completion": "If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts...."}
{"prompt": "'Drugged' is a stupid word.", "completion": "But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years."}
{"prompt": "How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?", "completion": "No, I guess not."}
{"prompt": "So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?", "completion": "Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised."}
{"prompt": "FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.", "completion": "Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.", "completion": "That's Jellybean!"}
{"prompt": "Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.", "completion": "You don't agree with Debbie, then?"}
{"prompt": "......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet\ufffdkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.", "completion": "What is Debbie's position?"}
{"prompt": "Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?", "completion": "Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy."}
{"prompt": "No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. \"Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it.\"", "completion": "Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink."}
{"prompt": "Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'", "completion": "You're political, then?"}
{"prompt": "About...", "completion": "About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl."}
{"prompt": "Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich\ufffds and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.", "completion": "Tell me about it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...", "completion": "No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone."}
{"prompt": "Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.", "completion": "Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast."}
{"prompt": "What guy?", "completion": "Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road."}
{"prompt": "If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'", "completion": "Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake."}
{"prompt": "I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.", "completion": "What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie."}
{"prompt": "Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.", "completion": "Whose fault was that?"}
{"prompt": "Well.... er...", "completion": "Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?"}
{"prompt": "Like what?", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?", "completion": "How does she like what in bed?"}
{"prompt": "Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?", "completion": "I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town."}
{"prompt": "It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.", "completion": "Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head."}
{"prompt": "She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?", "completion": "Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate."}
{"prompt": "My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.", "completion": "Extraordinary!"}
{"prompt": "I have to go, Julian.", "completion": "Why? Why do you have to go?"}
{"prompt": "Getting dressed. I've got to go.", "completion": "But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love."}
{"prompt": "It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.", "completion": "What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "I'm cold.", "completion": "Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner."}
{"prompt": "Whooee!", "completion": "As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace."}
{"prompt": "You're the best?", "completion": "When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways."}
{"prompt": "Hitchhiking?", "completion": "I'm the best."}
{"prompt": "So now you're bummin' around?", "completion": "Yep."}
{"prompt": "For magazines?", "completion": "I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off."}
{"prompt": "Are you in show business?", "completion": "I was a successful model once."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "American Cheese. The king of road food."}
{"prompt": "Going north?", "completion": "You bet your raggedy white ass I am."}
{"prompt": "I don't know anything about it.", "completion": "Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer..."}
{"prompt": "Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.", "completion": "Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?"}
{"prompt": "I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?", "completion": "Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However..."}
{"prompt": "Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.", "completion": "What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?"}
{"prompt": "But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?", "completion": "Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think..."}
{"prompt": "But Countess...", "completion": "Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender."}
{"prompt": "If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?", "completion": "Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another."}
{"prompt": "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.", "completion": "Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist."}
{"prompt": "A job for me?", "completion": "I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me."}
{"prompt": "Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.", "completion": "Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job..."}
{"prompt": "She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.", "completion": "Your ranch?"}
{"prompt": "Bonanza Jellybean?", "completion": "What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean."}
{"prompt": "Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?", "completion": "You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink."}
{"prompt": "I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.", "completion": "Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever."}
{"prompt": "A born freak can only go uphill.", "completion": "Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean."}
{"prompt": "Tired...", "completion": "That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling."}
{"prompt": "I think I found something...", "completion": "To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?"}
{"prompt": "Holy shit...", "completion": "Justin?"}
{"prompt": "Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?", "completion": "I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing."}
{"prompt": "...do you copy?", "completion": "Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here."}
{"prompt": "You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.", "completion": "I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man."}
{"prompt": "I can see why they sent you along.", "completion": "So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?"}
{"prompt": "That means top-secret, Cooper.", "completion": "I heard it."}
{"prompt": "Ballast.", "completion": "I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker..."}
{"prompt": "Will it work?", "completion": "It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks."}
{"prompt": "...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.", "completion": "You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives."}
{"prompt": "Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.", "completion": "On my way."}
{"prompt": "But Justin...", "completion": "I'll get him."}
{"prompt": "The containment, Second Containment...", "completion": "Hold on, Coop..."}
{"prompt": "We have a man down...", "completion": "Coop, where are you..."}
{"prompt": "You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...", "completion": "I'll be all over it."}
{"prompt": "You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?", "completion": "...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on..."}
{"prompt": "EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.", "completion": "From what?"}
{"prompt": "This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?", "completion": "...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --", "completion": "You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that..."}
{"prompt": "Time to play Spam in the can.", "completion": "Don't start with me, Cooper."}
{"prompt": "Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.", "completion": "Roger that."}
{"prompt": "We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.", "completion": "Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith..."}
{"prompt": "What about the accumulator...?", "completion": "It's holding... She's holding...!"}
{"prompt": "You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.", "completion": "We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU."}
{"prompt": "Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.", "completion": "You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel."}
{"prompt": "You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?", "completion": "I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you."}
{"prompt": "What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.", "completion": "I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking \"optical effect!\""}
{"prompt": "I don't know what happened to Justin.", "completion": "I'm telling you, I saw it..."}
{"prompt": "You weren't there. I saw it.", "completion": "Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible..."}
{"prompt": "It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...", "completion": "No, he didn't."}
{"prompt": "The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.", "completion": "Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?"}
{"prompt": "Coffee.", "completion": "No, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What...?", "completion": "Run!"}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.", "completion": "Hurry."}
{"prompt": "I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...", "completion": "I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead."}
{"prompt": "There must be a way! What about Engineering?", "completion": "Can you shut it down?"}
{"prompt": "You're okay now, it's over...", "completion": "How? The Bridge is gone."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, the screens are dead...!", "completion": "Let me breathe, let me breathe..."}
{"prompt": "It is not.", "completion": "What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "Oh God...", "completion": "Is that an offer?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...", "completion": "Please... kill..."}
{"prompt": "Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.", "completion": "Please..."}
{"prompt": "DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "\"Save yourself. From Hell.\"  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?", "completion": "No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it."}
{"prompt": "Hear what?", "completion": "It sounds like \"ex infera:\" \"ex,\" from; \"infera,\" the ablative case of \"inferi.\" \"Hell.\""}
{"prompt": "It gets worse.", "completion": "Do you hear it? Right there."}
{"prompt": "They thought it said, \"Liberatis me,\" \"Save me,\" but it's not \"me.\" It's \"tutemet:\" \"Save yourself.\"", "completion": "It's not a distress call. It's a warning."}
{"prompt": "I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.", "completion": "Go on."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "\"Another man?\" Who?", "completion": "I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide."}
{"prompt": "We'll make it.", "completion": "Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close."}
{"prompt": "I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.", "completion": "He'll live... if we ever make it back."}
{"prompt": "Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.", "completion": "To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep."}

{"prompt": "It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...", "completion": "A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.", "completion": "It's the Event Horizon. She's come back."}
{"prompt": "I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?", "completion": "Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?"}
{"prompt": "The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.", "completion": "You wanted to see me, Admiral?"}
{"prompt": "Some things you don't get over.", "completion": "I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?"}
{"prompt": "He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.", "completion": "It's been two years since she died. He's over it."}
{"prompt": "Does he know that?", "completion": "What's on your mind?"}
{"prompt": "The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.", "completion": "That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship."}
{"prompt": "You're not seriously considering sending him?", "completion": "You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein."}
{"prompt": "It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.", "completion": "Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response."}

{"prompt": "...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.", "completion": "How do you know all this?"}
{"prompt": "But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...", "completion": "Justin. I won't let you die."}
{"prompt": "...I don't want to die...!", "completion": "You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?"}

{"prompt": "Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...", "completion": "Patch me through to him."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir!", "completion": "Justin, finish your sweep."}
{"prompt": "Start the countdown.", "completion": "Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on."}
{"prompt": "Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.", "completion": "Everything green on my boards, Skipper."}
{"prompt": "The crew? Could they still be alive?", "completion": "The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years."}
{"prompt": "This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.", "completion": "Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes."}
{"prompt": "I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.", "completion": "I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.", "completion": "Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "This is Weir."}
{"prompt": "Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.", "completion": "I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there..."}
{"prompt": "That's a negative, Starck.", "completion": "Justin."}
{"prompt": "I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.", "completion": "Do it."}
{"prompt": "I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...", "completion": "Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.", "completion": "Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers."}

{"prompt": "Frozen.", "completion": "Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters..."}
{"prompt": "I found one.", "completion": "Alive?"}
{"prompt": "Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.", "completion": "The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I'm on the bridge.", "completion": "What you got, Peters?"}
{"prompt": "The blood came from somewhere, Peters...", "completion": "There's no one here, Skipper."}
{"prompt": "I can see the hatch.", "completion": "Starck, you still showing those readings?"}
{"prompt": "Peters is right, no one's here.", "completion": "I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing..."}
{"prompt": "That means they didn't abandon ship.", "completion": "So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus its huge.", "completion": "Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze."}
{"prompt": "We've got pressure.", "completion": "Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark."}
{"prompt": "No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.", "completion": "I am sorry. But now we have to go to work."}
{"prompt": "Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.", "completion": "I put in for a replacement for you but no one..."}
{"prompt": "NOOO!", "completion": "What's the hold up?"}
{"prompt": "Starck... Cooper...", "completion": "You can't have them. Go to hell."}
{"prompt": "You're lying...!", "completion": "I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me."}
{"prompt": "Better if I just show you.", "completion": "There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING."}
{"prompt": "I'm not the Devil.", "completion": "Then what, what are you? Tell me..."}
{"prompt": "You know.", "completion": "You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!"}
{"prompt": "Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?", "completion": "What are you?"}
{"prompt": "Weir is dead.", "completion": "Then who the fuck are you?"}
{"prompt": "If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.", "completion": "What makes you think I'll miss?"}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience."}
{"prompt": "Your eyes...", "completion": "I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see."}
{"prompt": "I told you... She won't let you leave...", "completion": "Son of a bitch!"}
{"prompt": "You can't leave. She won't let you.", "completion": "Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home."}
{"prompt": "You... You can't do that!", "completion": "Watch me."}
{"prompt": "What about my ship?", "completion": "We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship."}
{"prompt": "Don't... don't do this...", "completion": "It's done."}
{"prompt": "You're insane. You've lost your mind.", "completion": "Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark."}
{"prompt": "You can't, your orders are specific...", "completion": "\"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship.\" The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us."}
{"prompt": "That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.", "completion": "We're leaving."}
{"prompt": "The \"Other Place,\" what is that...?", "completion": "I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time."}

{"prompt": "To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?", "completion": "I don't know..."}
{"prompt": "You said this ship creates a gateway...", "completion": "Yes..."}
{"prompt": "That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!", "completion": "What do you want me to say?"}
{"prompt": "I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.", "completion": "Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --"}
{"prompt": "Is that your \"expert opinion?\" The only answer we've had out of you is \"I don't know.\"", "completion": "Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane."}
{"prompt": "I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.", "completion": "Do it."}
{"prompt": "Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.", "completion": "We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time."}
{"prompt": "The Core...!", "completion": "We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it."}
{"prompt": "Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.", "completion": "What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?"}
{"prompt": "Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.", "completion": "Explanation?"}
{"prompt": "The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.", "completion": "It's 2041..."}
{"prompt": "The date.", "completion": "What about it?"}
{"prompt": "Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.", "completion": "You have something, Dr. Weir?"}
{"prompt": "I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.", "completion": "There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control."}
{"prompt": "If it worked.", "completion": "If it worked, yes."}
{"prompt": "It's insane.", "completion": "\"Insane?\" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day..."}
{"prompt": "It's complicated...", "completion": "How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?"}
{"prompt": "It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.", "completion": "What could cause them?  What's in the Core?"}
{"prompt": "One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.", "completion": "Hold on, what's this \"gravitational distortion?\""}
{"prompt": "Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.", "completion": "It beats dying, Mister Smith."}
{"prompt": "Negative.", "completion": "No one?"}
{"prompt": "Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.", "completion": "Any survivors?"}
{"prompt": "In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.", "completion": "Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep."}
{"prompt": "Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?", "completion": "I can see that, what're they for?"}
{"prompt": "-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.", "completion": "You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering."}
{"prompt": "Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --", "completion": "That is not acceptable --"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.", "completion": "Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship..."}
{"prompt": "Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.", "completion": "Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure..."}
{"prompt": "NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...", "completion": "That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there."}
{"prompt": "That's what we're here to find out.", "completion": "What does it say?"}
{"prompt": "It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.", "completion": "Where has it been for the last seven years?"}
{"prompt": "I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.", "completion": "Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way."}
{"prompt": "Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...", "completion": "Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why."}
{"prompt": "Captain Miller, I just want to say...", "completion": "The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks."}
{"prompt": "Where is it, where is it...", "completion": "Smith? Smith! Fuck!"}
{"prompt": "No, no, we just got her back together...", "completion": "Get out of there now!"}
{"prompt": "One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.", "completion": "Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock."}
{"prompt": "Smith, get out of there...", "completion": "Come again, Skipper?"}
{"prompt": "What is it, Smith?", "completion": "I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark."}
{"prompt": "Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.", "completion": "Skipper..."}
{"prompt": "Now what?", "completion": "She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Captain, we got a problem."}
{"prompt": "Sir.", "completion": "Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly."}
{"prompt": "...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...", "completion": "That's enough!"}
{"prompt": "We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.", "completion": "Understood."}
{"prompt": "I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?", "completion": "I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time."}
{"prompt": "You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?", "completion": "Captain Miller, you copy?"}
{"prompt": "They're gone.", "completion": "But..."}
{"prompt": "We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.", "completion": "No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?"}
{"prompt": "Do we have enough time for a weld?", "completion": "We don't have time to fart."}
{"prompt": "Smith, where the hell have you been?!", "completion": "We have a situation here..."}
{"prompt": "Starck, give me a read.", "completion": "Captain Miller..."}
{"prompt": "Love to.", "completion": "It is now.  We're locked in."}
{"prompt": "Starck...", "completion": "Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?"}
{"prompt": "Where is it?", "completion": "Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!"}
{"prompt": "I noticed. Starck, anybody home?", "completion": "1500 meters. We're getting too close..."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Weir...!", "completion": "We've got some weather."}
{"prompt": "I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "What are you trying to say? \"If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?\"", "completion": "Something like that, yeah."}
{"prompt": "We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...", "completion": "That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know..."}
{"prompt": "We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.", "completion": "Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening..."}
{"prompt": "...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...", "completion": "One-four degrees..."}
{"prompt": "What is that?", "completion": "Heading three-three-four..."}
{"prompt": "Locked and cocked.", "completion": "Jesus..."}
{"prompt": "He's dead...", "completion": "I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?"}
{"prompt": "Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...", "completion": "Weir."}
{"prompt": "We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...", "completion": "...repeat, we're armed..."}
{"prompt": "I'll do it --", "completion": "No. I'll be right back."}
{"prompt": "Blow it up?", "completion": "We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put..."}
{"prompt": "We've got to shut it down, we've got to...", "completion": "BLOW THE FUCKER UP."}
{"prompt": "Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.", "completion": "Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place."}
{"prompt": "Five seconds.", "completion": "Weir can't be alive."}
{"prompt": "You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.", "completion": "Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!"}
{"prompt": "Stay here! Don't stop working!", "completion": "I'm on my way, Starck."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit."}
{"prompt": "What's going on in there, Starck?", "completion": "Justin's in the airlock."}
{"prompt": "I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.", "completion": "Miller, come in..."}
{"prompt": "What I want is to survive the next ten hours.", "completion": "Nine hours and twenty-two minutes."}
{"prompt": "If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?", "completion": "I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have."}
{"prompt": "Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.", "completion": "I know that."}
{"prompt": "We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...", "completion": "It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports..."}
{"prompt": "To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?", "completion": "I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us..."}
{"prompt": "There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...", "completion": "You've got to listen..."}
{"prompt": "I've got a theory.", "completion": "Go ahead."}
{"prompt": "...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...", "completion": "\"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,\" don't you have anything useful to tell me?"}
{"prompt": "Miller...", "completion": "What is it, Starck?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe one of the original crew?", "completion": "No. It was someone else."}
{"prompt": "I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.", "completion": "Do it. Dr. Weir..."}
{"prompt": "What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...", "completion": "Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.", "completion": "So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?"}
{"prompt": "The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: \"Bio-readings of indeterminate origin.\" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.", "completion": "What's causing the readings?"}
{"prompt": "I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.", "completion": "What about the life readings you picked up?"}
{"prompt": "It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.", "completion": "We can take the filters from the Clark..."}
{"prompt": "Oxygen is not the problem.", "completion": "Carbon dioxide?"}
{"prompt": "The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.", "completion": "How much oh-two do we have?"}
{"prompt": "It tastes bad.", "completion": "But you can breathe it."}
{"prompt": "We're all here.", "completion": "Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought."}
{"prompt": "Keep your eyes open.", "completion": "Everybody okay?"}
{"prompt": "There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.", "completion": "That's an affirmative."}
{"prompt": "Something's wrong with the bio-scan.", "completion": "Radiation interference?"}
{"prompt": "Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.", "completion": "Come around to three-three-four..."}
{"prompt": "I just finished drying...", "completion": "Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.", "completion": "Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?"}
{"prompt": "Justin?", "completion": "Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes."}
{"prompt": "I've seen bodies before. This is different.", "completion": "We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready."}
{"prompt": "About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...", "completion": "Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?"}
{"prompt": "No. I saw nothing.", "completion": "I did."}
{"prompt": "Can you see a body?", "completion": "There's no one here."}
{"prompt": "Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?", "completion": "Blood. Looks like arterial spray."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?", "completion": "You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?"}
{"prompt": "Here's another one. They're all over the place.", "completion": "They're explosive charges."}
{"prompt": "Claire...", "completion": "DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe."}
{"prompt": "Wasn't that ship destroyed?", "completion": "They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able..."}
{"prompt": "He's been past Mars?", "completion": "He served on the Goliath."}

{"prompt": "You got any coffee?", "completion": "It's cold."}
{"prompt": "We have to do something, oh God...", "completion": "Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay..."}
{"prompt": "Almost got it.", "completion": "Come on, Baby-bear, open this door..."}
{"prompt": "Keep him talking.", "completion": "Do you know what it was?"}
{"prompt": "Can you shut it down?", "completion": "Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it."}

{"prompt": "Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.", "completion": "What...?  Oh."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "We need to get past them."}
{"prompt": "It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.", "completion": "Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap."}
{"prompt": "What? What do you mean you --", "completion": "Sue... look at your hands."}
{"prompt": "You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.", "completion": "Uh, Sue...? I can't."}
{"prompt": "Passion.", "completion": "For science."}
{"prompt": "I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --", "completion": "Which was?"}
{"prompt": "You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.", "completion": "You're happy for me and Victor."}
{"prompt": "Yes, thanks.", "completion": "That's good. That's uh... good."}
{"prompt": "Great minds think alike.", "completion": "Feeling better?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...", "completion": "Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this."}
{"prompt": "It's been changed.", "completion": "As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --"}
{"prompt": "Right. That's exactly what I meant.", "completion": "I, uh, think I remember the number."}
{"prompt": "I was talking about us. Working together.", "completion": "Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--"}
{"prompt": "Never better.", "completion": "Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --"}
{"prompt": "Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.", "completion": "You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--"}
{"prompt": "What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.", "completion": "But I'm not done with the machine --"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --", "completion": "Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --"}
{"prompt": "Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --", "completion": "I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --"}
{"prompt": "I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?", "completion": "Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage."}
{"prompt": "Ben did this?", "completion": "He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one."}
{"prompt": "Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?", "completion": "Ben did this."}
{"prompt": "Not until Ben is back inside!", "completion": "It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Ben, come on...", "completion": "Reed, we're running out of time."}
{"prompt": "Ben's still out there --", "completion": "So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly."}
{"prompt": "We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.", "completion": "Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields..."}
{"prompt": "Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "Funny how things turn out, isn't it?", "completion": "Hilarious."}
{"prompt": "You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --", "completion": "The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents."}
{"prompt": "This isn't going to be a problem, is it?", "completion": "Not at all."}
{"prompt": "But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.", "completion": "You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I think you already have.", "completion": "Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready."}
{"prompt": "Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.", "completion": "Please don't make this personal --"}
{"prompt": "Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?", "completion": "If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us."}
{"prompt": "Susan. What are you doing?", "completion": "He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --"}
{"prompt": "It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...", "completion": "Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --"}
{"prompt": "Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.", "completion": "You said it was urgent."}
{"prompt": "I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.", "completion": "I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --"}
{"prompt": "Just find him.", "completion": "Victor, your scar --"}
{"prompt": "Victor, are you feeling alright?", "completion": "Victor, I'm sorry I --"}
{"prompt": "You can't leave them out there.", "completion": "What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "Raising the shields."}
{"prompt": "Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...", "completion": "Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives..."}
{"prompt": "It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.", "completion": "Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --"}
{"prompt": "I understand the business reasons.", "completion": "Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past."}
{"prompt": "I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.", "completion": "Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?"}
{"prompt": "Skeptical...?", "completion": "It's just business."}
{"prompt": "Reed's gonna fix me up --", "completion": "For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical."}
{"prompt": "If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --", "completion": "I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back."}
{"prompt": "'Scuse me.", "completion": "I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back..."}
{"prompt": "I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.", "completion": "All right!!"}
{"prompt": "You want to work at Carl's?", "completion": "Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys."}
{"prompt": "Arnold. What's happening?", "completion": "Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill."}
{"prompt": "Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.", "completion": "Brad, can I talk to you a minute?"}
{"prompt": "Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.", "completion": "I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year."}
{"prompt": "Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.", "completion": "If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back."}
{"prompt": "Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!", "completion": "I don't want to talk about it here, Brad."}
{"prompt": "What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...", "completion": "Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool."}
{"prompt": "How much did they cost?", "completion": "Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "Were those flowers really for me, Brad?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Easy, mon.", "completion": "Later."}
{"prompt": "First door on your left!", "completion": "There it is!"}
{"prompt": "It's the first door on your left!", "completion": "On the ledge?"}
{"prompt": "It's the first door on your left.", "completion": "I can't find it, mon!"}
{"prompt": "Go ahead. Just make it quick.", "completion": "Totally."}
{"prompt": "Something happened to them, mon.", "completion": "Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?"}
{"prompt": "You really want me to put all this stuff back on?", "completion": "Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton."}
{"prompt": "I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.", "completion": "Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!"}
{"prompt": "This is how I dress all the time.", "completion": "But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform."}
{"prompt": "Manager!!", "completion": "Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?"}
{"prompt": "I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...", "completion": "Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass."}
{"prompt": "Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?", "completion": "I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here."}
{"prompt": "See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.", "completion": "I can't do that. But if you wait a minute..."}
{"prompt": "No. I want my money back right now.", "completion": "Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too..."}
{"prompt": "All right, then. It's your secret.", "completion": "Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here."}
{"prompt": "You're not going to tell me, are you?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?", "completion": "Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad..."}
{"prompt": "See you later.", "completion": "Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "It's just Linda. And Mark from school.", "completion": "Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do."}
{"prompt": "Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!", "completion": "Does Mom know you have company?"}
{"prompt": "Are you still a virgin?", "completion": "Maybe yes. Maybe no."}
{"prompt": "I didn't say that.", "completion": "But your face did!"}
{"prompt": "Maybe yes. Maybe no.", "completion": "You are a virgin!"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "I don't know. I was just curious."}
{"prompt": "Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.", "completion": "Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?"}
{"prompt": "Well... it's true.", "completion": "Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa."}
{"prompt": "Where did you hear that?", "completion": "I'm just guessing."}
{"prompt": "I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.", "completion": "Why? Because she won't sleep with you?"}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.", "completion": "You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.", "completion": "Is everything okay at work?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?", "completion": "It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him."}
{"prompt": "I'll explain everything later.", "completion": "Thanks for getting rid of those flowers."}
{"prompt": "Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?", "completion": "I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?"}
{"prompt": "Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?", "completion": "They're not home yet."}
{"prompt": "I take out the garbage.", "completion": "Don't strain yourself."}
{"prompt": "Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.", "completion": "Your friends use the pool too."}
{"prompt": "Mom says to clean up the pool.", "completion": "Why can't you do it?"}
{"prompt": "U.S. History. Mr. Hand.", "completion": "Hey-yo."}
{"prompt": "Sis.", "completion": "Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?"}
{"prompt": "You're fired.", "completion": "Hi, Brad."}
{"prompt": "Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?", "completion": "He insulted me first. He called me a moron."}
{"prompt": "Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.", "completion": "Okay, Dennis."}
{"prompt": "Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.", "completion": "But they weren't mine."}
{"prompt": "Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?", "completion": "They were left over from the last shift."}
{"prompt": "Any problems?", "completion": "No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis."}
{"prompt": "Jeff you have company!", "completion": "Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you."}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone.", "completion": "Dad says!"}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone!", "completion": "Dad says you're late again, you butthole!"}
{"prompt": "Dad says you have to get up!", "completion": "Ugh."}
{"prompt": "All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.", "completion": "Get going."}
{"prompt": "Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.", "completion": "Mike! You have a mess on C-9!"}
{"prompt": "Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?", "completion": "Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.", "completion": "It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic."}
{"prompt": "There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.", "completion": "We've got to get an abortion?"}
{"prompt": "Take that back.", "completion": "All right, I take it back."}
{"prompt": "How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.", "completion": "I know it's yours."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you call me up tonight?", "completion": "Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant."}
{"prompt": "Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.", "completion": "What? Now?"}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.", "completion": "I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you."}
{"prompt": "Oh. Hi.", "completion": "I didn't see you this morning."}
{"prompt": "I think I came. Didn't you feel it?", "completion": "I guess I did."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.", "completion": "What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "What? Are you all right?", "completion": "I think we're making a lot of noise."}
{"prompt": "Let's continue.", "completion": "Hey, Mike?"}
{"prompt": "How about both of us at the same time?", "completion": "I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?", "completion": "You first."}
{"prompt": "So are you.  Are you shaking?", "completion": "No. Are you crazy?"}
{"prompt": "He's my friend, too.", "completion": "You're a really good kisser."}
{"prompt": "Come on...", "completion": "Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. It's getting pretty late...", "completion": "Are you really a virgin?"}
{"prompt": "Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!", "completion": "Pick a suit."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to take a quick swim?", "completion": "Well..."}
{"prompt": "Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?", "completion": "I know what I look like."}
{"prompt": "I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Do you have any ice tea?", "completion": "Sure. Come on in."}
{"prompt": "You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?", "completion": "Mark is a really nice boy..."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.", "completion": "What a guy."}
{"prompt": "I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.", "completion": "Get a ride with somebody."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.", "completion": "O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?"}
{"prompt": "Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!", "completion": "Oh, really?"}
{"prompt": "Nice to meet you, Stacy.", "completion": "Nice to meet you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.", "completion": "It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond."}
{"prompt": "What do you read? What's the last book you read?", "completion": "Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough."}
{"prompt": "So what makes you so sensitive?", "completion": "Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people."}
{"prompt": "Sensitive -- what is that?", "completion": "Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking."}
{"prompt": "Whatever you say, Rat.", "completion": "And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive."}
{"prompt": "You're crazy. Those girls love me.", "completion": "The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl."}
{"prompt": "Fine. Get lost.", "completion": "You're losing it, Damone."}
{"prompt": "Jesus. I'm sorry.", "completion": "I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out."}
{"prompt": "She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.", "completion": "Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?"}
{"prompt": "If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?", "completion": "No Damone. I don't understand."}
{"prompt": "No. I don't think so. Not right now.", "completion": "Chicken!"}
{"prompt": "Poor guy.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "Well, I've gotta be running.", "completion": "Okay. See ya."}
{"prompt": "I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?", "completion": "Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Mark. Is that you?", "completion": "Damone! You come here?"}
{"prompt": "Damone, are you there?", "completion": "I'm really pretty busy..."}
{"prompt": "Did you go home and get it?", "completion": "No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?"}
{"prompt": "Mark. What happened to your date?", "completion": "It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home."}
{"prompt": "Yo.", "completion": "Damone. It's Mark."}
{"prompt": "I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.", "completion": "You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts..."}
{"prompt": "All right. Pay attention.", "completion": "And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.", "completion": "Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?"}
{"prompt": "Ace the jacket.", "completion": "Knock it off, Damone. I need real help."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Rat.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.", "completion": "There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall."}
{"prompt": "The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.", "completion": "The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith."}
{"prompt": "Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.", "completion": "That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.", "completion": "Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens."}
{"prompt": "I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.", "completion": "You tell me, Mike. What do I do?"}
{"prompt": "I would. Yeah.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.", "completion": "Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'"}
{"prompt": "Did you get her name?", "completion": "No. It's too soon."}
{"prompt": "Did you get her number?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "All right... where did you see her?", "completion": "She's in my biology class."}
{"prompt": "It's definitely your mama.", "completion": "Damone, you gotta listen to me."}
{"prompt": "You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.", "completion": "What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her."}
{"prompt": "Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.", "completion": "You should work for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.", "completion": "And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either."}
{"prompt": "And they don't call my parents?", "completion": "Not if you're over sixteen."}
{"prompt": "I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.", "completion": "All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's."}
{"prompt": "Are you Linda Barrett?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?", "completion": "Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards."}
{"prompt": "Are you going to ride that wave?", "completion": "Totally."}
{"prompt": "Who's that?", "completion": "That's me, Merv."}
{"prompt": "Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.", "completion": "Fascinating."}
{"prompt": "I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?", "completion": "Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?"}
{"prompt": "How often do you go?", "completion": "I don't go at all."}
{"prompt": "I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...", "completion": "School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time."}
{"prompt": "I've been swimming, Merv.", "completion": "Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains."}
{"prompt": "Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.", "completion": "I was going to say... your eyes look a little red."}
{"prompt": "Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...", "completion": "How've you been?"}
{"prompt": "You can't fix this car, Spicoli.", "completion": "That's him! He did it!"}
{"prompt": "First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.", "completion": "Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car."}
{"prompt": "My brother is gonna shit.", "completion": "Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?"}
{"prompt": "My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.", "completion": "Just be glad you're all right."}
{"prompt": "We just missed the turnoff to the party.", "completion": "You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "My brother's car!", "completion": "All right. Die, Granada Jocks!"}
{"prompt": "It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!", "completion": "They're fuckin' with us."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck is this guy doing?", "completion": "This ain't no cop."}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "I like sex."}
{"prompt": "Naw. Any good?", "completion": "Suzanne Somers' tits."}
{"prompt": "Then don't hassle it.", "completion": "Seen the new Playboy?"}
{"prompt": "I thought he was out of town.", "completion": "He is."}
{"prompt": "Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.", "completion": "Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe it! But what about Doug?", "completion": "There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them."}
{"prompt": "Dartmouth?!", "completion": "I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it."}
{"prompt": "But what are you going to do?", "completion": "Well I might go to Dartmouth."}
{"prompt": "Sometime?", "completion": "Yeah, like maybe never."}
{"prompt": "Not coming? What happened?", "completion": "He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Where's Doug?", "completion": "He's not coming."}
{"prompt": "I want romance.", "completion": "Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV."}
{"prompt": "You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.", "completion": "What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Another summer of working at Swenson's.", "completion": "Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open."}
{"prompt": "Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.", "completion": "Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!"}
{"prompt": "I paid for it and everything.", "completion": "There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this."}
{"prompt": "Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.", "completion": "That little prick."}
{"prompt": "I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...", "completion": "That little prick."}
{"prompt": "You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.", "completion": "You're right. I didn't tell you that."}
{"prompt": "You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.", "completion": "But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too."}
{"prompt": "It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.", "completion": "Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!"}
{"prompt": "What do you think it is?", "completion": "It couldn't be."}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I just don't feel right.", "completion": "What do you think it is?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.", "completion": "You have been acting very strange the last few weeks."}
{"prompt": "God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.", "completion": "God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban."}
{"prompt": "I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.", "completion": "Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "God, he hardly even talks anymore."}
{"prompt": "I think they're both virgins.", "completion": "I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?"}
{"prompt": "He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.", "completion": "What's Doug do in Chicago?"}
{"prompt": "Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'", "completion": "How long does Doug take?"}
{"prompt": "Does that ever happen?", "completion": "No. But it's a nice idea."}
{"prompt": "All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'", "completion": "Climax together."}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?", "completion": "You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck."}
{"prompt": "Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'", "completion": "Okay, penis, that's one, balls..."}
{"prompt": "You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.", "completion": "Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?"}
{"prompt": "Sixteen.", "completion": "I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here."}
{"prompt": "What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.", "completion": "Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?"}
{"prompt": "Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.", "completion": "Thanks a lot."}
{"prompt": "Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.", "completion": "I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out."}
{"prompt": "Not since November.", "completion": "Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?"}
{"prompt": "I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.", "completion": "I guess Ron hasn't called yet."}
{"prompt": "Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.", "completion": "You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy."}
{"prompt": "Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.", "completion": "If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen."}
{"prompt": "Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.", "completion": "Does Doug care that you're seventeen?"}
{"prompt": "Hey! That's my line!", "completion": "There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen."}
{"prompt": "So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?", "completion": "Come on, Linda. It's just sex."}
{"prompt": "You'll always remember your first time.", "completion": "It was nice."}
{"prompt": "Was it great?", "completion": "It was okay."}
{"prompt": "Just kidding. About 10cc.", "completion": "Oh! That's where that group got its name from."}
{"prompt": "Well I never did it.", "completion": "There's nothing to it."}
{"prompt": "Like, you know, giving blow jobs.", "completion": "What's the big deal?"}
{"prompt": "No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.", "completion": "What variables?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.", "completion": "What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't."}
{"prompt": "Do you think guys find that attractive?", "completion": "Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them."}
{"prompt": "Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "No way! He just called him a dick.", "completion": "God. People exaggerate so much at this school."}
{"prompt": "Believe it.", "completion": "I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning."}
{"prompt": "If I didn't have a fianc\ufffd in Chicago, I'd go for it.", "completion": "I can't believe I start high school tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.", "completion": "He was hot, wasn't he?"}
{"prompt": "Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.", "completion": "I can't do that."}
{"prompt": "Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.", "completion": "So what did you do?"}
{"prompt": "Should we buy a frame for that?", "completion": "Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?"}
{"prompt": "Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.", "completion": "He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'"}
{"prompt": "Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.", "completion": "What should I do?"}
{"prompt": "Don't you like him?", "completion": "Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really."}
{"prompt": "How's it going.", "completion": "Do you think that guy's cute?"}
{"prompt": "Aloha, Mr. Hand!", "completion": "Aloha, Spicoli."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.", "completion": "All right! Oh, yeah!"}
{"prompt": "If you graduate.", "completion": "You're gonna flunk me?!"}
{"prompt": "Well, you'll find out next year.", "completion": "No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building."}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?"}
{"prompt": "I think I've made my point with you tonight.", "completion": "Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.", "completion": "Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you."}
{"prompt": "Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.", "completion": "Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to sit there, Jeff?", "completion": "I don't know. I guess so."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.", "completion": "Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?"}
{"prompt": "Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?", "completion": "Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year."}
{"prompt": "Mr... Mr. Hand.", "completion": "That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?"}
{"prompt": "You better save some for me, you swine!", "completion": "And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.", "completion": "I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?"}
{"prompt": "Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?", "completion": "Learning about Cuba. Having some food."}
{"prompt": "Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?", "completion": "I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?", "completion": "I couldn't make it in time."}
{"prompt": "Hey, bud. What's your problem?", "completion": "Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!"}
{"prompt": "You just ripped my card in two!", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Spicoli?", "completion": "That's the name they gave me."}
{"prompt": "Can I come in?", "completion": "Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here."}
{"prompt": "This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'm registered for this class.", "completion": "What class?"}
{"prompt": "Is this your first time?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What about those other guys you live with?", "completion": "No. I mean back to your home."}
{"prompt": "Yes... I am really nineteen.", "completion": "I think I better take you home."}
{"prompt": "It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?", "completion": "Are you really nineteen?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks. Thanks a lot.", "completion": "It's very warm out tonight."}
{"prompt": "All right, the point it is.", "completion": "That's a nice shirt."}
{"prompt": "How about the point?", "completion": "The point sounds fine."}
{"prompt": "Where do you feel like going?", "completion": "I don't know. Wherever you want."}
{"prompt": "'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.", "completion": "Thanks. So do you."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for picking me up.", "completion": "No problem."}
{"prompt": "What can I get for you tonight.", "completion": "How about your phone number?"}
{"prompt": "You look like you could still be in high school.", "completion": "I know, everyone says that."}
{"prompt": "Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.", "completion": "I'd like that."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.", "completion": "I know everybody says it, but I really mean it."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Stacy. How are you?", "completion": "I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year."}
{"prompt": "I'll get you the notes.", "completion": "Hi, Mark."}
{"prompt": "Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.", "completion": "What about the notes?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. I see.", "completion": "I made a fool of myself."}
{"prompt": "John Bonham?", "completion": "John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday."}
{"prompt": "What's April 16th?", "completion": "It's John Bonham's birthday."}
{"prompt": "Where's Mike today?", "completion": "Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th."}
{"prompt": "Do you really have to go?", "completion": "Well... it's getting kind of late."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.", "completion": "...I've got to go home."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?"}
{"prompt": "So... pretty nice house you've got here.", "completion": "Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.", "completion": "Naw. I don't mind."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?", "completion": "No. That's okay."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Sure. I'll come in.", "completion": "Where's your brother?"}
{"prompt": "Aren't your parents asleep?", "completion": "No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house."}
{"prompt": "I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.", "completion": "Do you want to come inside?"}
{"prompt": "I had a really nice time tonight.", "completion": "Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck."}
{"prompt": "Sure. I'll... have another Coke.", "completion": "Two more Cokes."}
{"prompt": "Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?", "completion": "Not at all."}
{"prompt": "Are you all right?", "completion": "Oh yeah."}
{"prompt": "I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.", "completion": "Excellent."}
{"prompt": "I've heard that, too.", "completion": "Do you know what you want?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. She is pretty good.", "completion": "Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant."}
{"prompt": "Do you have Mrs. George for English?", "completion": "Yeah. She is pretty good."}
{"prompt": "This is a nice car.", "completion": "Yeah. It's my sister's."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for coming to get me.", "completion": "Sure thing."}
{"prompt": "Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.", "completion": "Oh... yes."}
{"prompt": "What's your other question?", "completion": "My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?"}
{"prompt": "You keep them.", "completion": "We keep them, in case the people come back."}
{"prompt": "What do you do with the jackets people leave here?", "completion": "We keep them."}
{"prompt": "Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?", "completion": "I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?"}
{"prompt": "Two Cokes.", "completion": "Okay. Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.", "completion": "Anything to drink?"}
{"prompt": "Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.", "completion": "Are you ready to order here?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.", "completion": "What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?"}
{"prompt": "Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.", "completion": "Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police..."}
{"prompt": "Crying? Why was she crying?", "completion": "Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention..."}
{"prompt": "Tell me. What do you want?", "completion": "The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying..."}
{"prompt": "IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!", "completion": "Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?"}
{"prompt": "WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!", "completion": "Killed?"}
{"prompt": "Holy shit!", "completion": "Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering..."}
{"prompt": "What's the message? My light is blinking.", "completion": "Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: \"Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.\""}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.", "completion": "Well, thank you."}
{"prompt": "My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?", "completion": "Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you.\"", "completion": "Certainly, Mr. Duke!"}
{"prompt": "Righto!", "completion": "Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying..."}
{"prompt": "Not for me.", "completion": "Let's have lunch!"}
{"prompt": "Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.", "completion": "There's no hurry! The race is over!"}
{"prompt": "Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.", "completion": "But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?"}
{"prompt": "Awake? What do you mean?", "completion": "Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand."}
{"prompt": "You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.", "completion": "Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?"}
{"prompt": "He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.", "completion": "What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel."}
{"prompt": "Yes... It makes sense.", "completion": "I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?"}
{"prompt": "Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.", "completion": "Dobermans don't talk."}
{"prompt": "Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.", "completion": "WHAT?"}
{"prompt": "Naked!?", "completion": "Naked."}
{"prompt": "Naw! That's science fiction stuff!", "completion": "Not where we operate."}
{"prompt": "They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.", "completion": "Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!"}
{"prompt": "Rum and ice, please.", "completion": "You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean by that?", "completion": "You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!"}
{"prompt": "Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.", "completion": "You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy."}
{"prompt": "Naw! Not a major.", "completion": "He wanted the pineal gland."}
{"prompt": "A major!", "completion": "We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house."}
{"prompt": "And nobody did anything?", "completion": "Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines."}
{"prompt": "What happened? What did they do to her?", "completion": "Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!"}
{"prompt": "They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.", "completion": "Not down in my parts."}
{"prompt": "You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.", "completion": "Naw!"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.", "completion": "I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God!...", "completion": "This is my granddaughter..."}
{"prompt": "I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.", "completion": "That's a fine combination. You can't lose."}
{"prompt": "Las Vegas.", "completion": "A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!", "completion": "Where ya comin' from, young man?"}
{"prompt": "Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...", "completion": "Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me."}
{"prompt": "I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?", "completion": "Hell, no!"}
{"prompt": "Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.", "completion": "Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once..."}
{"prompt": "Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?", "completion": "Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!"}
{"prompt": "Never missed a plane yet.", "completion": "No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!"}
{"prompt": "We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.", "completion": "The airport is over there!"}
{"prompt": "Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.", "completion": "What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!"}
{"prompt": "I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.", "completion": "How much is the lemon meringue pie?"}
{"prompt": "There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...", "completion": "Two glasses of ice water with ice."}
{"prompt": "Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.", "completion": "Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!"}
{"prompt": "Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.", "completion": "Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month."}
{"prompt": "I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.", "completion": "Do you think you can handle it?"}
{"prompt": "FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?", "completion": "So do we, lady."}
{"prompt": "...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...", "completion": "Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland."}
{"prompt": "...grow claws... bleeding warts.", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...", "completion": "Right!"}
{"prompt": "Extract of pineal!", "completion": "Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia."}
{"prompt": "Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.", "completion": "Some of what?"}
{"prompt": "I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.", "completion": "I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought..."}
{"prompt": "Never mind, it's absolutely pure.", "completion": "Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!"}
{"prompt": "I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.", "completion": "Where'd you get this?"}
{"prompt": "Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...", "completion": "I remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid.\""}
{"prompt": "You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.", "completion": "Adrenochrome..."}
{"prompt": "Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.", "completion": "It's gone too far."}
{"prompt": "Me?", "completion": "She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?"}
{"prompt": "Lucy is looking for you.", "completion": "No, she's looking for you."}
{"prompt": "They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.", "completion": "Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that."}
{"prompt": "We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.", "completion": "Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps."}
{"prompt": "Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.", "completion": "Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line."}
{"prompt": "They were all veterans.", "completion": "What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it."}
{"prompt": "...and every one of them stacked naked...", "completion": "Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons."}
{"prompt": "They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...", "completion": "Like big lizards."}
{"prompt": "Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!", "completion": "What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s."}
{"prompt": "Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!", "completion": "Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to."}
{"prompt": "Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.", "completion": "Read the newspapers."}
{"prompt": "Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.", "completion": "This is a fucking nightmare."}
{"prompt": "They're actually nice people when you get to know them.", "completion": "Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!"}
{"prompt": "Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...", "completion": "I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!"}
{"prompt": "As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.", "completion": "Maybe we should take it easy tonight."}
{"prompt": "I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.", "completion": "That's good. You can't be subtle in this town."}
{"prompt": "Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...", "completion": "I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done."}
{"prompt": "It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.", "completion": "Us?"}
{"prompt": "We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.", "completion": "What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?"}
{"prompt": "You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.", "completion": "The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney."}
{"prompt": "In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.", "completion": "NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!"}
{"prompt": "I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.", "completion": "You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in."}
{"prompt": "It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.", "completion": "NO! Stop talking like that."}
{"prompt": "She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.", "completion": "Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff."}
{"prompt": "Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.", "completion": "Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible."}
{"prompt": "Lucy.", "completion": "Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink."}
{"prompt": "WELL? What are your plans?", "completion": "Plans?"}
{"prompt": "You degenerate pig!", "completion": "It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\""}
{"prompt": "What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!", "completion": "You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport."}
{"prompt": "You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!", "completion": "What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?"}
{"prompt": "There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!", "completion": "Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious."}
{"prompt": "Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!", "completion": "The cops?"}
{"prompt": "Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...", "completion": "You cheap honky sonofabitch..."}
{"prompt": "Are you ready?", "completion": "You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?"}
{"prompt": "Do it! I want to get HIGHER!", "completion": "Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it."}
{"prompt": "BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.", "completion": "Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!", "completion": "Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!"}
{"prompt": "I want that fucking radio!", "completion": "Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!"}
{"prompt": "How about a check?", "completion": "Whatever's right."}
{"prompt": "OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.", "completion": "Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?"}
{"prompt": "You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.", "completion": "I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on."}
{"prompt": "What tape?", "completion": "Jefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\" I want a rising sound."}
{"prompt": "You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.", "completion": "Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on."}
{"prompt": "Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?", "completion": "Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot."}
{"prompt": "What limes?", "completion": "They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert."}
{"prompt": "Where'd you get that knife?", "completion": "Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes."}
{"prompt": "That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?", "completion": "That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!"}
{"prompt": "He told me he was turning in early...", "completion": "That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!"}
{"prompt": "No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.", "completion": "Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk."}
{"prompt": "What for?", "completion": "Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose."}
{"prompt": "You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.", "completion": "Yeah... I thought we might need it..."}
{"prompt": "Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.", "completion": "Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us."}
{"prompt": "Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.", "completion": "Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?"}
{"prompt": "It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.", "completion": "Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back."}
{"prompt": "Do they pay you to screw that bear?", "completion": "When does this thing stop?"}
{"prompt": "I want to leave fast.", "completion": "OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk."}
{"prompt": "Can we make it?", "completion": "That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door."}
{"prompt": "No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!", "completion": "OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.", "completion": "Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours."}
{"prompt": "I have to go.", "completion": "GO?"}
{"prompt": "Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?", "completion": "Not much. Why?"}
{"prompt": "That's what gives me The Fear.", "completion": "Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear."}
{"prompt": "I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.", "completion": "Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve."}
{"prompt": "Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?", "completion": "Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep."}
{"prompt": "Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.", "completion": "Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling."}
{"prompt": "We wandered into a fucking time capsule!", "completion": "This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here."}
{"prompt": "Jesus creeping shit!", "completion": "Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!"}
{"prompt": "Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.", "completion": "What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Why what?"}
{"prompt": "Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?", "completion": "To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!"}
{"prompt": "Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!", "completion": "How about \"Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?\" \"Hot Slots,\" that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs..."}
{"prompt": "I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.", "completion": "They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up."}
{"prompt": "You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...", "completion": "That's good..."}
{"prompt": "Not yet. I want to study its habits.", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "No, no. Don't leave me!", "completion": "Shoot it."}
{"prompt": "But what about our room? And the golf shoes?", "completion": "That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room."}
{"prompt": "If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.", "completion": "I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!"}
{"prompt": "Lacerda?", "completion": "I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!"}
{"prompt": "Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.", "completion": "Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?"}
{"prompt": "How long do I have?", "completion": "Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid."}
{"prompt": "You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.", "completion": "You whore!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?", "completion": "God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!"}
{"prompt": "Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!", "completion": "And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?"}
{"prompt": "Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.", "completion": "The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?"}
{"prompt": "You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!", "completion": "What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!"}
{"prompt": "The medicine? Yes, it's right here.", "completion": "Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?"}
{"prompt": "My heart!", "completion": "Where's the medicine?"}
{"prompt": "My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!", "completion": "He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me."}
{"prompt": "...and we're chock full of that!", "completion": "Damn right!"}
{"prompt": "We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.", "completion": "We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture."}
{"prompt": "O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?", "completion": "Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars."}
{"prompt": "I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.", "completion": "Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?"}
{"prompt": "God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.", "completion": "Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right."}
{"prompt": "Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?", "completion": "It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull."}
{"prompt": "If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...", "completion": "Jesus! Did I say that?"}
{"prompt": "We're your friends. We're not like the others.", "completion": "No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you."}
{"prompt": "\"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus.\"", "completion": "One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats."}
{"prompt": "The password is: \"One Hand Washes The Other.\" The minute you hear that, you say \"I fear nothing.\"", "completion": "I fear nothing."}
{"prompt": "You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?", "completion": "Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice."}
{"prompt": "No! I swear I'm not!", "completion": "You'd pay me for that?"}
{"prompt": "I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!", "completion": "Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it."}
{"prompt": "Nobody. I'm the maid!", "completion": "The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?"}
{"prompt": "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!", "completion": "What made you do it? Who paid you off?"}
{"prompt": "I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.", "completion": "Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!..."}
{"prompt": "How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.", "completion": "Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?"}
{"prompt": "A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.", "completion": "Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?"}
{"prompt": "That's a strange attitude.", "completion": "You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?"}
{"prompt": "You realize...", "completion": "Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal."}
{"prompt": "Could I have that, please?", "completion": "Why not? It was getting warm anyway."}
{"prompt": "May I see your license.", "completion": "Of course, officer."}
{"prompt": "Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...", "completion": "Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people."}
{"prompt": "You and a lot of other people.", "completion": "Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?"}
{"prompt": "One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.", "completion": "Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!", "completion": "In that case, maybe she can help."}
{"prompt": "Part of what?", "completion": "Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman."}
{"prompt": "I don't know what you're talking about!", "completion": "Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!"}
{"prompt": "They'll get in! We'll all die!", "completion": "You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?"}
{"prompt": "They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!", "completion": "YOU'RE KILLING HIM!"}
{"prompt": "Stop!", "completion": "What the fuck are you doing he's in there!"}
{"prompt": "Spare me.", "completion": "I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?", "completion": "It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.", "completion": "Where is everyone?"}
{"prompt": "Where are you two going?", "completion": "We're going to get my little girl."}
{"prompt": "We'll meet in three hours?", "completion": "I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have..."}
{"prompt": "You know where it is?", "completion": "Um, yeah, thirty miles east."}
{"prompt": "They'll be back.", "completion": "Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!"}
{"prompt": "He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.", "completion": "Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!"}
{"prompt": "Don't be stupid, drop the gun!", "completion": "We should go! We should go right now!"}
{"prompt": "I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --", "completion": "I will not die because of him!"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Careful."}
{"prompt": "You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!", "completion": "We can't risk letting them in."}
{"prompt": "I don't think you should...", "completion": "With what just happened upstairs --"}
{"prompt": "I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.", "completion": "I got shells too, box and a half, tops."}
{"prompt": "Well, it don't look pretty.", "completion": "But it's got teeth."}
{"prompt": "My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?", "completion": "Her fella."}
{"prompt": "IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?", "completion": "Nah, I got the gun."}
{"prompt": "IS IT CLEAR?!", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "We shot a skunk.", "completion": "We're lucky to be alive."}
{"prompt": "Stop it.", "completion": "Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?"}
{"prompt": "Who the hell would you call?", "completion": "Anyone."}
{"prompt": "Gonna stay for a couple?", "completion": "I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here."}
{"prompt": "You gotta be with me on this.", "completion": "One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry."}
{"prompt": "We'll be food, dickheads!", "completion": "Well, your last words can be \"I told you so.\""}
{"prompt": "You got something better?", "completion": "If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all."}
{"prompt": "Wha?", "completion": "OPEN THE DOOR!"}
{"prompt": "Oh!", "completion": "\"OH!?\" WHAT IS \"OH?\" What does \"oh\" mean?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.", "completion": "Come on, come on."}
{"prompt": "Where's that?", "completion": "Upstairs."}
{"prompt": "C'mon guys--", "completion": "I think I know where a CB is."}
{"prompt": "Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.", "completion": "Hey! Get quiet or get out."}
{"prompt": "Just move!", "completion": "You seem mighty collected about this."}
{"prompt": "Shit!", "completion": "I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first."}
{"prompt": "In the corner, behind the curtain.", "completion": "We just smeared a skunk."}
{"prompt": "Follow me.", "completion": "Where's the tunnel?"}
{"prompt": "This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.", "completion": "You all sure about this?"}
{"prompt": "What!? I'm not going down there again!", "completion": "This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go."}
{"prompt": "What's it for?", "completion": "HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him."}
{"prompt": "What tunnel? Where?", "completion": "It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there."}
{"prompt": "Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --", "completion": "There's a tunnel."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.", "completion": "Easy."}
{"prompt": "They're right here.", "completion": "Hey!"}
{"prompt": "No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.", "completion": "Well, justice is funny."}
{"prompt": "And the head?", "completion": "So, your husband ditched you?"}
{"prompt": "Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.", "completion": "And that's how I ended up here."}
{"prompt": "That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.", "completion": "And the rest of 'em?"}
{"prompt": "Just an observation.", "completion": "Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?"}
{"prompt": "Look.", "completion": "That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?"}
{"prompt": "Ohhh.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.", "completion": "The door... on three."}
{"prompt": "No. You?", "completion": "Of course not. I fight monsters all the time."}
{"prompt": "Get in line!", "completion": "Scared?"}
{"prompt": "You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.", "completion": "Fuck you too."}
{"prompt": "What now, Geronimo?", "completion": "My truck."}
{"prompt": "Come on!", "completion": "He's dead."}
{"prompt": "We're better off.", "completion": "Who's with me?"}
{"prompt": "Well then I guess we should just give up.", "completion": "Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah?", "completion": "Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?"}
{"prompt": "Go douche.", "completion": "I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it."}
{"prompt": "Any more ideas Animal Planet?", "completion": "You weren't helpin'."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you go check it out?", "completion": "Fuck no."}
{"prompt": "We lived near power lines.", "completion": "So, what now? Did those things leave?"}
{"prompt": "Yep.", "completion": "Your parents of relation?"}
{"prompt": "Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.", "completion": "Your brother, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Just cover me. It was built to move.", "completion": "Why do you take shit from him?"}
{"prompt": "But not flush against the tunnel?", "completion": "It's imperative that you get that truck moving."}
{"prompt": "Nothing, this was my last delivery.", "completion": "Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back."}
{"prompt": "My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.", "completion": "What's in the back?"}
{"prompt": "All right!  Tell us about the truck!", "completion": "Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here."}
{"prompt": "We gotta be close.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "We gotta try.", "completion": "Anybody else?"}
{"prompt": "Anyone else?", "completion": "We're going to get help."}
{"prompt": "Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.", "completion": "I'm in."}
{"prompt": "You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.", "completion": "What? Really?"}
{"prompt": "How much I got, what?", "completion": "How much you got to see the show?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "How much you got?"}
{"prompt": "The girl's got rhythm.", "completion": "You wanna see, baby?"}
{"prompt": "I can't feel a thing, Hon.", "completion": "Um-hmmm."}
{"prompt": "Okay then.", "completion": "Doesn't your foot hurt?"}
{"prompt": "But --", "completion": "It's much safer in there, sweety."}
{"prompt": "Why not then?", "completion": "Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there."}
{"prompt": "Will I go crazy or something?", "completion": "No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no.", "completion": "It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm."}
{"prompt": "What is this?", "completion": "Magic potion.  You should try a little."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue."}
{"prompt": "Well...", "completion": "Push and twist, it's child proof."}
{"prompt": "I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.", "completion": "How are you holding up?"}
{"prompt": "What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!", "completion": "Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!"}
{"prompt": "Seven.", "completion": "Keys."}
{"prompt": "Seven.", "completion": "Nine?"}
{"prompt": "Holds four.", "completion": "Max?"}
{"prompt": "Covered.", "completion": "How many?"}
{"prompt": "Two.", "completion": "Open?"}
{"prompt": "Fully.", "completion": "Four door?"}
{"prompt": "Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.", "completion": "Is it gassed up?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "What's it for!?"}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "What's going on between you two?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What do you mean what?"}
{"prompt": "You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.", "completion": "Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "In the kitchen, under the sink."}
{"prompt": "Will these boards hold?", "completion": "The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "He shot you the other time."}
{"prompt": "So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?", "completion": "He only shot you once."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.", "completion": "Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex."}
{"prompt": "He's dead.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "My husband...", "completion": "Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?"}
{"prompt": "I'll go with ya.", "completion": "What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't do that, son.", "completion": "They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy."}
{"prompt": "Sit still, look less like a meal.", "completion": "I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew."}
{"prompt": "You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.", "completion": "Oh? And what's that?"}
{"prompt": "This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.", "completion": "Whoa!"}
{"prompt": "What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?", "completion": "Get outta here."}
{"prompt": "Blow the goddamn hatch!", "completion": "Clear!"}
{"prompt": "Clever fuckers.", "completion": "What the hell's going on here!?"}
{"prompt": "Bullshit.", "completion": "No bullshit."}
{"prompt": "Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.", "completion": "Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "They were all over the place.", "completion": "You smell like ass!"}
{"prompt": "Welcome back.", "completion": "F-f-fuck you."}
{"prompt": "Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?", "completion": "There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, maybe.", "completion": "Get something on that."}
{"prompt": "COME ON!", "completion": "HELLLLLLLLP!!"}
{"prompt": "SHIT.", "completion": "MOVE YOUR ASS!"}
{"prompt": "Hurry!", "completion": "REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!"}
{"prompt": "JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!", "completion": "If he doesn't shut up..."}
{"prompt": "Shit!", "completion": "I'm fine! I'm fine!"}
{"prompt": "Move it!", "completion": "You keep that key handy."}
{"prompt": "Move slow and move quiet.", "completion": "No shit."}
{"prompt": "Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.", "completion": "Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral."}
{"prompt": "Gimme the keys.", "completion": "NO, but I will lock you in."}
{"prompt": "Duh hickey.", "completion": "Fine, Chief."}
{"prompt": "HOLD THAT TIGHT!", "completion": "'Eh, Chief?"}
{"prompt": "HELLLPPP!", "completion": "Got 'cha!"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.", "completion": "OH JESUS!"}
{"prompt": "Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.", "completion": "Am I too heavy for you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.", "completion": "Amazing you made it this far."}
{"prompt": "HELP MEEE!", "completion": "BONSAI!"}
{"prompt": "You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?", "completion": "I'm sure."}
{"prompt": "I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.", "completion": "You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it."}
{"prompt": "Ok. Let's see what happens.", "completion": "Let's move."}
{"prompt": "Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?", "completion": "Yeah, I'll go."}
{"prompt": "Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?", "completion": "Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?"}
{"prompt": "As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.", "completion": "Hey!"}
{"prompt": "They'll tear this place down within the hour.", "completion": "Well, maybe they migrate?"}
{"prompt": "YOU'LL HIT US!", "completion": "Let's wait it out."}
{"prompt": "She's not very nice, is she?", "completion": "DON'T!"}
{"prompt": "Nothing, just lookin'.", "completion": "Let's go."}
{"prompt": "Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?", "completion": "What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "GO-GO-GO!!", "completion": "Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?"}
{"prompt": "Go!!!", "completion": "Get to your cars!"}
{"prompt": "Go! Go!", "completion": "Not without you!!!"}
{"prompt": "If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.", "completion": "Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?"}
{"prompt": "Let's go!", "completion": "Wait God-dammit!"}
{"prompt": "Hold it!", "completion": "Whoa!"}
{"prompt": "There's a rifle and a shotgun here.", "completion": "That's fine."}
{"prompt": "Okay, well that's something.", "completion": "So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks."}
{"prompt": "And the last one is the...", "completion": "Father. The biggest, the strongest..."}
{"prompt": "I think --", "completion": "If you are face to face with her, dive left."}
{"prompt": "I'd love to.", "completion": "Did we make it?"}
{"prompt": "Deal.", "completion": "We should stick together out there."}
{"prompt": "I'll do anything to help.", "completion": "I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side."}
{"prompt": "Oh...", "completion": "She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Her name is Charlie."}
{"prompt": "I admire your strength.", "completion": "We all have to be strong, right?"}
{"prompt": "You know you don't have to do this.", "completion": "I'm fine, I really am."}
{"prompt": "Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.", "completion": "All right."}
{"prompt": "Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.", "completion": "Let's lock off this room."}
{"prompt": "Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!", "completion": "Stop her!"}
{"prompt": "Oh my God... What is that?", "completion": "That's one piece of four problems."}
{"prompt": "What have you done now, broke the darn thing?", "completion": "I just hit it like you said."}
{"prompt": "You know that no one likes a liar, right?", "completion": "I said I'm not lying."}
{"prompt": "What did we say about lying?", "completion": "I'm not lying."}
{"prompt": "Are you lying to me?", "completion": "Well..."}
{"prompt": "Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?", "completion": "Um, well..."}
{"prompt": "Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?", "completion": "Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir."}
{"prompt": "'Forgive'...? For What?", "completion": "I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words."}
{"prompt": "Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?", "completion": "Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you."}
{"prompt": "Putting on my armor.", "completion": "Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out."}
{"prompt": "Refill my drink, will you, Bob?", "completion": "What're you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.", "completion": "Frances?  Oh no."}
{"prompt": "Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.", "completion": "So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?"}
{"prompt": "Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?", "completion": "You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em."}
{"prompt": "Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!", "completion": "But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change."}
{"prompt": "Well... come on.", "completion": "This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster."}
{"prompt": "Oh. I mean, good.", "completion": "I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!"}
{"prompt": "Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.", "completion": "That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, sir?", "completion": "I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me."}
{"prompt": "And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.", "completion": "I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me..."}
{"prompt": "I guess so, sir.", "completion": "Very fine bone structure."}
{"prompt": "Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.", "completion": "Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?"}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Mr. Bebe!", "completion": "Who's this?"}
{"prompt": "Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.", "completion": "I'd like nothing better."}
{"prompt": "But I'm the one up there on the screen.", "completion": "That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act."}
{"prompt": "But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.", "completion": "No, I'm concerned with everything."}
{"prompt": "Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.", "completion": "Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?"}
{"prompt": "Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called \"Come and Get It.\"", "completion": "Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --"}
{"prompt": "Thank you --", "completion": "I intend to make a great deal of money off you."}
{"prompt": "You see: We've got to change that name.", "completion": "I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --"}
{"prompt": "...acts. I'll relay your message.", "completion": "That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?", "completion": "I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'"}
{"prompt": "That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.", "completion": "Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies."}
{"prompt": "You know what I mean.", "completion": "Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.", "completion": "I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --", "completion": "It's a perfectly good car. It runs."}
{"prompt": "Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.", "completion": "My clothes?"}
{"prompt": "Hi Frances, got a minute?", "completion": "Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way."}
{"prompt": "Huh.", "completion": "Come here. I want to show you something."}
{"prompt": "Oh well. I guess I better leave then.", "completion": "Okay, but come here first."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Madam...?"}
{"prompt": "God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!", "completion": "Good, good. Give them that."}
{"prompt": "I'm not!", "completion": "You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --"}
{"prompt": "I'm not!", "completion": "You're afraid!"}
{"prompt": "He knows, Frances.", "completion": "Face it! Confess it! You're weak!"}
{"prompt": "Right now we have to be practical.", "completion": "Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "I know, but --", "completion": "What does Clifford say?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.", "completion": "But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!"}
{"prompt": "An actress.", "completion": "A rich actress."}
{"prompt": "What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.", "completion": "You don't think I'm good enough?"}
{"prompt": "I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.", "completion": "That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "What's up?"}
{"prompt": "Where's Clifford?", "completion": "He's not here."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Harold.", "completion": "Frances."}
{"prompt": "...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.", "completion": "I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford."}
{"prompt": "Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...", "completion": "Who is she?"}
{"prompt": "The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --", "completion": "Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me."}
{"prompt": "GET OUT!", "completion": "You're under arrest."}
{"prompt": "You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --", "completion": "Get your clothes on, lady --"}
{"prompt": "I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.", "completion": "Get your clothes on."}
{"prompt": "Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says \"Dimout Zone?\"  There's a war on, you know?", "completion": "Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, where's the fire, sister?", "completion": "In my eyes, officer."}
{"prompt": "The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!", "completion": "You want his name?"}
{"prompt": "No. It's all about that night, isn't it?", "completion": "What night?"}
{"prompt": "I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.", "completion": "No?"}
{"prompt": "Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!", "completion": "Dick..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.", "completion": "Dick, I can't even breathe here..."}
{"prompt": "You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?", "completion": "Dick, we need some time apart --"}
{"prompt": "Without me.", "completion": "Showdown."}
{"prompt": "There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?", "completion": "...Yes."}
{"prompt": "Fired?", "completion": "Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand."}
{"prompt": "Claire?", "completion": "Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?"}
{"prompt": "Sort of.", "completion": "There've been some calls."}
{"prompt": "Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.", "completion": "You learn your lines?"}
{"prompt": "We're all square now, Harry. Right?", "completion": "All square, Doc."}
{"prompt": "Harry!", "completion": "I gotta go now."}
{"prompt": "Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!", "completion": "Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?"}
{"prompt": "Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...", "completion": "I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing."}
{"prompt": "Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!", "completion": "The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her."}
{"prompt": "We'll get you home, Frances.", "completion": "Thank you, Harry."}
{"prompt": "One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?", "completion": "Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry."}
{"prompt": "...I see.", "completion": "We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later."}
{"prompt": "You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?", "completion": "Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you."}
{"prompt": "No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.", "completion": "Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice."}
{"prompt": "...Don't you?", "completion": "I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?"}
{"prompt": "Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.", "completion": "I know you believe that."}
{"prompt": "New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "This is the answer: a subscription drive to \"Voice of Action!\" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!", "completion": "But I'll never win that."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Ralph.", "completion": "Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!"}
{"prompt": "Were you a drug addict?", "completion": "No. Never."}
{"prompt": "Were you an alcoholic?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?", "completion": "...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one..."}
{"prompt": "Are you... are you hungry?", "completion": "I pity us, Dad. I pity us both."}
{"prompt": "Please, Francie...", "completion": "Daddy!"}
{"prompt": "But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.", "completion": "You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?"}
{"prompt": "They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.", "completion": "Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you."}
{"prompt": "Francie, you know I can't do that.", "completion": "Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again."}
{"prompt": "I don't care, Dad. I love you.", "completion": "I love you too, Francie."}
{"prompt": "Always. Always.", "completion": "I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and..."}
{"prompt": "Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.", "completion": "Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?"}
{"prompt": "What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.", "completion": "But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.", "completion": "I know that, Dad, but --"}
{"prompt": "Be careful, Francie.", "completion": "...So what do you think?"}
{"prompt": "...Then go.", "completion": "I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad."}
{"prompt": "And you think it's worth all this?", "completion": "If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it."}
{"prompt": "You really want to go?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.", "completion": "What do I do, Dad?"}
{"prompt": "And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --", "completion": "Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --"}
{"prompt": "It's already started, Dad... with me.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.", "completion": "He's a socialist, then?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.", "completion": "Is Kaminski a Communist?"}
{"prompt": "Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?", "completion": "He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble."}
{"prompt": "You wrote it, didn't you?", "completion": "Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?"}
{"prompt": "An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.", "completion": "I didn't have much to do with it."}
{"prompt": "I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.", "completion": "Thanks, Dad."}
{"prompt": "Bye, baby.", "completion": "See you next weekend, Dad."}
{"prompt": "Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.", "completion": "That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought."}
{"prompt": "As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.", "completion": "Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "See you next weekend?"}
{"prompt": "That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.", "completion": "I'm going back to the hotel."}
{"prompt": "How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!", "completion": "No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism."}
{"prompt": "You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --", "completion": "They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways."}
{"prompt": "You're poisoning that child's mind.", "completion": "I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve..."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?"}
{"prompt": "I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.", "completion": "Bread?"}
{"prompt": "Oh Angela, my own... Angela!", "completion": "It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air."}
{"prompt": "No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!", "completion": "Oh, Kurt!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...", "completion": "But, Kurt, I..."}
{"prompt": "Occupation?", "completion": "Kurt!"}
{"prompt": "Address?", "completion": "Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!"}
{"prompt": "Age?", "completion": "Fifteen."}
{"prompt": "Name?", "completion": "I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!"}
{"prompt": "Just one minute...", "completion": "You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me."}
{"prompt": "Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?", "completion": "Why, you... you little bastard!"}
{"prompt": "Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "What about your husband?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.", "completion": "They'll mend."}
{"prompt": "Aren't you ever going back?", "completion": "...Not if I can help it."}
{"prompt": "You sound as if you hate it.", "completion": "No, I don't hate it."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you."}
{"prompt": "Why... yes.", "completion": "Then don't go to Hollywood."}
{"prompt": "Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!", "completion": "Are you really serious? About acting?"}
{"prompt": "Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.", "completion": "Are you an actor?"}
{"prompt": "Only if you were in it. Are you?", "completion": "I wouldn't miss it."}
{"prompt": "I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?", "completion": "You can always come see it in London."}
{"prompt": "That would be okay.", "completion": "Just a little way."}
{"prompt": "Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.", "completion": "Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "No, we're not."}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure.", "completion": "Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?"}
{"prompt": "I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...", "completion": "It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?"}
{"prompt": "Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...", "completion": "Why do you say that?"}
{"prompt": "I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you...  ...ennh.", "completion": "Well... you're looking well."}
{"prompt": "Sure I did, that's why I'm here.", "completion": "How did I look?"}
{"prompt": "How... how ya doin', Farmer?", "completion": "Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?"}
{"prompt": "C'mere. I want to talk to you.", "completion": "Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you."}
{"prompt": "No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.", "completion": "I hope so, Frances."}
{"prompt": "Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.", "completion": "Right. Except... time has a way of --"}
{"prompt": "Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.", "completion": "Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I don't know.", "completion": "You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me."}
{"prompt": "Oh Harry...", "completion": "This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it."}
{"prompt": "I love you too, Frances.", "completion": "Where to?"}
{"prompt": "...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.", "completion": "I love you, Harry. I love you."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Frances, it's me, Harry?"}
{"prompt": "I got your number, Mister Man.", "completion": "Frances! Frances!"}
{"prompt": "I know. Don't tell anyone.", "completion": "Anyway... if you need me..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.", "completion": "Frances, You're crazy."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.", "completion": "You give up on her?"}
{"prompt": "Will you marry me?", "completion": "It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing."}
{"prompt": "There's just one more thing.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?", "completion": "Well... I'll act like I do until I do."}
{"prompt": "You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.", "completion": "Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?"}
{"prompt": "Why are you always leaving me, Harry?", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "To quarter-horses.", "completion": "No. To thoroughbreds."}
{"prompt": "What a man!", "completion": "Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground."}
{"prompt": "Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!", "completion": "Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!"}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "You can't drink."}
{"prompt": "I guess.", "completion": "Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!", "completion": "You know something, Harry?"}
{"prompt": "Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.", "completion": "No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all."}
{"prompt": "A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.", "completion": "Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think I'd be much good in a war...", "completion": "Whattaya think you're in now?"}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "...Take advantage of me."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone..."}
{"prompt": "Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.", "completion": "I should've known..."}
{"prompt": "Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?", "completion": "Where are we, mean man?"}
{"prompt": "That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?", "completion": "Forget it, Frances. You're not driving."}
{"prompt": "You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.", "completion": "Evening, gorgeous."}
{"prompt": "Who said I was a lady?", "completion": "Oh my God, I look awful."}
{"prompt": "Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.", "completion": "Take a walk, pal."}
{"prompt": "I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.", "completion": "And?"}
{"prompt": "No, Harry, I can't --", "completion": "You're coming."}
{"prompt": "Beats me.", "completion": "Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?"}
{"prompt": "So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?", "completion": "Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?"}
{"prompt": "I'll bet.", "completion": "I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt."}
{"prompt": "Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.", "completion": "I took the early rounds."}
{"prompt": "For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.", "completion": "Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it."}
{"prompt": "Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "Help yourself. Everyone else has.", "completion": "Nice joint. Can you afford it?"}
{"prompt": "What's left of my blood.", "completion": "Think I'll have a glass."}
{"prompt": "How the hell do you find me anyway?", "completion": "Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?"}
{"prompt": "Frances...", "completion": "Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!"}
{"prompt": "Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!", "completion": "Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!"}
{"prompt": "I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.", "completion": "Calm down, Frances."}
{"prompt": "Harry? Harry, where are you?!", "completion": "Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?"}
{"prompt": "I'm serious, Frances. This is important.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "The chauffeur. He's watching.", "completion": "He deserves a show. He missed the movie."}
{"prompt": "Don't start, Farmer.", "completion": "It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving."}
{"prompt": "The hell you will, Harry York.", "completion": "Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.", "completion": "Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy."}
{"prompt": "But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...", "completion": "What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?"}
{"prompt": "I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?", "completion": "Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better."}
{"prompt": "No, they don't, do they?", "completion": "Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything."}
{"prompt": "You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.", "completion": "If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?"}
{"prompt": "Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.", "completion": "Forget it."}
{"prompt": "You're telling me.", "completion": "Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --"}
{"prompt": "Is that why you did it?", "completion": "Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --"}
{"prompt": "Shit. I meant the other way around.", "completion": "Well, the studio told me not to."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Hey that's great, Farmer, just great."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?", "completion": "Serious, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.", "completion": "Harry... I met someone."}
{"prompt": "I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.", "completion": "I know what ability you're interested in."}
{"prompt": "You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.", "completion": "Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now."}
{"prompt": "But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?", "completion": "He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus.", "completion": "Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die."}
{"prompt": "Oh no...", "completion": "Eight stories."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "They killed him. They threw him out that window."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.", "completion": "Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid."}
{"prompt": "Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?", "completion": "Kaminski."}
{"prompt": "Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?", "completion": "Came to get a tan."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.", "completion": "How ya doin', Farmer?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Well... don't you think it's up to me to..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Frances..."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...", "completion": "You don't know what you want."}
{"prompt": "...So you think I should go.", "completion": "Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it."}
{"prompt": "He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.", "completion": "I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life."}
{"prompt": "You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.", "completion": "What happened to him?"}
{"prompt": "Quietly.", "completion": "You're not the quiet type, Frances."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.", "completion": "Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it."}
{"prompt": "You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?", "completion": "Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid."}
{"prompt": "Enh.", "completion": "Don't be a rat, Harry."}
{"prompt": "I just wanted to see how you looked.", "completion": "How'd I look?"}
{"prompt": "You think I'd miss it?", "completion": "Well? What'd you think?"}
{"prompt": "Harry.", "completion": "Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?"}
{"prompt": "Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.", "completion": "Harry."}
{"prompt": "Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.", "completion": "I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.", "completion": "Sure don't talk like you're sixteen."}
{"prompt": "But I'm not. The newspapers're --", "completion": "Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy."}
{"prompt": "Whattaya mean?", "completion": "Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --"}
{"prompt": "You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...", "completion": "Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!", "completion": "Yeah, well --"}
{"prompt": "I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?", "completion": "Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here."}
{"prompt": "Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?", "completion": "No... Actually, you look more like a cop."}
{"prompt": "Not me. But other people seem to.", "completion": "Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it."}
{"prompt": "Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?", "completion": "I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.", "completion": "Okay then..."}
{"prompt": "Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!", "completion": "Don't touch me."}
{"prompt": "Shit!", "completion": "Run!"}
{"prompt": "What'd you do?", "completion": "You know, I've never been able to figure that out."}
{"prompt": "Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Wherever they're going, I'm going.", "completion": "Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Where you goin'?"}
{"prompt": "It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...", "completion": "And no people."}
{"prompt": "You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.", "completion": "Pretty morning."}
{"prompt": "Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.", "completion": "Fine!"}
{"prompt": "Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.", "completion": "Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --"}
{"prompt": "That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?", "completion": "Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?"}
{"prompt": "Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...", "completion": "You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady."}
{"prompt": "I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?", "completion": "Did you expect him to look you up?"}
{"prompt": "No, I couldn't get my hands on one.", "completion": "Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?"}
{"prompt": "Who's writing this guy's lines?", "completion": "Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?"}
{"prompt": "I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.", "completion": "...Is that not true?"}
{"prompt": "You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Who're you?", "completion": "I live here."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.", "completion": "What happened? Who're you?"}
{"prompt": "You think I got it?", "completion": "You got it."}
{"prompt": "How's it sound?", "completion": "The speech? Real good."}
{"prompt": "'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, \"This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!\" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'", "completion": "I already have."}
{"prompt": "'But how do I know you love me?'", "completion": "Your big speech?"}
{"prompt": "Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!", "completion": "Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you."}
{"prompt": "But I want to. I'm trying!", "completion": "I need an incendiary! An arsonist!"}
{"prompt": "I'm not!", "completion": "Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!"}
{"prompt": "That's me, Clifford.", "completion": "I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --"}
{"prompt": "And what's the title of this seduc... assault?", "completion": "'Golden Boy.'"}
{"prompt": "But what --", "completion": "No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready."}
{"prompt": "I have!", "completion": "No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!"}
{"prompt": "I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.", "completion": "You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!"}
{"prompt": "I will, I promise.", "completion": "Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you for understanding, Mama.", "completion": "Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway."}
{"prompt": "No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.", "completion": "You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back."}
{"prompt": "No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.", "completion": "Oh, just leave those things for now."}
{"prompt": "Frances!", "completion": "Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind."}
{"prompt": "You're not going anywhere!", "completion": "Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life."}
{"prompt": "Where are you going?", "completion": "I'm going out!"}
{"prompt": "And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!", "completion": "You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would."}
{"prompt": "You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!", "completion": "Mama, shut up!"}
{"prompt": "You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!", "completion": "I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!"}
{"prompt": "They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!", "completion": "Haven't you heard what I said?"}
{"prompt": "Don't... talk crazy.", "completion": "Mama...?"}
{"prompt": "Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --", "completion": "Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Mama.", "completion": "I'm back, Mama."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Mama.", "completion": "I don't want you drinking, Frances."}
{"prompt": "I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.", "completion": "You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Say you promise."}
{"prompt": "I'll be back.", "completion": "At one. Promise?"}
{"prompt": "Not long.", "completion": "I'll have lunch ready by one."}
{"prompt": "For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.", "completion": "How long will you be?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "I think I need a little air.", "completion": "What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.", "completion": "Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy."}
{"prompt": "Well, who have we here...?", "completion": "Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Go on..."}
{"prompt": "It's your fan mail, little sister.", "completion": "You kill me, Mama."}
{"prompt": "Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.", "completion": "Then why did you bring them?"}
{"prompt": "And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...", "completion": "Why are these all opened?"}
{"prompt": "Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!", "completion": "Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!"}
{"prompt": "Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.", "completion": "You're taking me home!"}
{"prompt": "It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.", "completion": "Mama, what's..."}
{"prompt": "It's okay.", "completion": "Smile, little sister, smile."}
{"prompt": "I don't care.", "completion": "...You will."}
{"prompt": "It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.", "completion": "Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --"}
{"prompt": "I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --", "completion": "Oh, Mama, don't you understand?"}
{"prompt": "But they're using you!", "completion": "Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Ma.", "completion": "And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself."}
{"prompt": "I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.", "completion": "Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?"}
{"prompt": "Oh bullshit.", "completion": "Mama..."}
{"prompt": "Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.", "completion": "No, my dear. You must be mistaken."}
{"prompt": "Don't I know you?", "completion": "I don't believe so."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me.", "completion": "Yes...?"}
{"prompt": "Sedate her.", "completion": "On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!", "completion": "Symington says..."}
{"prompt": "I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!", "completion": "Frances, I'm warning you..."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!"}
{"prompt": "I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.", "completion": "Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?"}
{"prompt": "You what?", "completion": "Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?"}
{"prompt": "Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.", "completion": "Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.", "completion": "But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?"}
{"prompt": "And you accused her of tampering with your mail.", "completion": "Oh for Christ's..."}
{"prompt": "She told me you said, \"Mama, you want to kill me.\"", "completion": "I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said..."}
{"prompt": "Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You're telling me you feel guilty.", "completion": "No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all."}
{"prompt": "Really? Any problems?", "completion": "Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake."}
{"prompt": "...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?", "completion": "Yes. It was very good to see her."}
{"prompt": "Is there something else?", "completion": "You didn't say 'Symington says'."}
{"prompt": "I'll have someone show you to your room.", "completion": "Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away."}
{"prompt": "Stay calm, please.", "completion": "No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, \"Doctor?\""}
{"prompt": "Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.", "completion": "This whole thing is a joke!"}
{"prompt": "All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.", "completion": "...Did you really say that?"}
{"prompt": "And what's that?", "completion": "Normal. Average."}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me."}
{"prompt": "Please sit down...", "completion": "You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian."}
{"prompt": "Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...", "completion": "Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?"}
{"prompt": "Why, Doctor! We've only just met!", "completion": "Oh! Are you really?"}
{"prompt": "It ain't for lack of trying.", "completion": "So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?"}
{"prompt": "Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.", "completion": "I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor."}
{"prompt": "Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?", "completion": "Thanks are hardly necessary."}
{"prompt": "Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!", "completion": "I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance."}
{"prompt": "Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?", "completion": "No! No!"}
{"prompt": "Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "'Incurable.'"}
{"prompt": "You're kidding.", "completion": "Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight."}
{"prompt": "Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.", "completion": "I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant."}
{"prompt": "I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.", "completion": "What kindness?"}
{"prompt": "Then why weep for him?", "completion": "Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine."}
{"prompt": "You drove him to his torment.", "completion": "And he drove me to mine."}
{"prompt": "What is that to you? Evil as you are.", "completion": "I am as he made me. In his own image."}
{"prompt": "I was watching.", "completion": "I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him."}
{"prompt": "You were with him at the end.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "People can be kinder than you think.", "completion": "I am afraid."}
{"prompt": "Why do you not go to them?", "completion": "I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful"}
{"prompt": "Friends? Do they live around here?", "completion": "Yes. Very close"}
{"prompt": "You're an outcast.", "completion": "Yes. I have been seeking my friends."}
{"prompt": "It can't be as bad as that.", "completion": "Worse."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you."}
{"prompt": "I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.", "completion": "Better that way... for me."}
{"prompt": "Nice.", "completion": "The music? Or the fire?"}
{"prompt": "GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!", "completion": "SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!"}
{"prompt": "She's not for you.", "completion": "I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor."}
{"prompt": "That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.", "completion": "She's beautiful."}
{"prompt": "You will honor your promise to me!", "completion": "I will not! Kill me now!"}
{"prompt": "What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.", "completion": "No. I draw the line."}
{"prompt": "A brain. Extremities.", "completion": "This was not taken from a grave."}
{"prompt": "Her body pleases me.", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "I'll be waiting. And watching.", "completion": "Why... her?"}
{"prompt": "Soon?", "completion": "Yes. I want this over and done with."}
{"prompt": "And if I consent?", "completion": "We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow."}
{"prompt": "Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.", "completion": "I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein."}
{"prompt": "Friend?", "completion": "A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me."}
{"prompt": "What can I do?", "completion": "There is something I want.  A friend."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Then perhaps I believe in evil after all."}
{"prompt": "Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.", "completion": "Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?"}
{"prompt": "You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?", "completion": "In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered."}
{"prompt": "What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?", "completion": "Materials. Nothing more."}
{"prompt": "Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?", "completion": "There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand."}
{"prompt": "I see it before me.", "completion": "I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth."}
{"prompt": "How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.", "completion": "Evil?  Do you believe in evil?"}
{"prompt": "Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.", "completion": "Your crime... as well as mine."}
{"prompt": "Then why am I here? What did you want with me?", "completion": "More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?"}
{"prompt": "Kill me and have done with it.", "completion": "Kill you? Hardly that."}
{"prompt": "How did you find me?", "completion": "The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely."}
{"prompt": "You speak.", "completion": "Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Come warm yourself if you like."}
{"prompt": "Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.", "completion": "Are you all right?"}
{"prompt": "Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.", "completion": "And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor."}
{"prompt": "So have I", "completion": "I should go. I should leave today."}
{"prompt": "It's been months. It's not like him.", "completion": "Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg."}
{"prompt": "He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a \"pompous...  Fellow...\"", "completion": "Nothing. Still nothing."}
{"prompt": "And you look so lovely.", "completion": "Must've been a terrible row."}
{"prompt": "One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...", "completion": "You dance so beautifully together."}
{"prompt": "Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!", "completion": "Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?"}
{"prompt": "That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.", "completion": "Quite right!"}
{"prompt": "Poor William! What indignant tears!", "completion": "There, there... shhh..."}
{"prompt": "Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.", "completion": "It's far too late for him to still be out."}
{"prompt": "Have you seen Willie?", "completion": "Is he not back yet?"}
{"prompt": "What does it say?", "completion": "Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me."}
{"prompt": "He always was opinionated.", "completion": "He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!"}
{"prompt": "Victor!", "completion": "Open this door for no-one!"}
{"prompt": "I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.", "completion": "I have been waiting for this ever since."}
{"prompt": "Brother and sister no more.", "completion": "Now husband and wife."}
{"prompt": "Victor, tell me why! Trust me!", "completion": "I do. But you must trust me for now."}
{"prompt": "Does this have something to do with that man you saw?", "completion": "Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay."}
{"prompt": "It is", "completion": "We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need."}
{"prompt": "Why the change? What about your work?", "completion": "It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?"}
{"prompt": "A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.", "completion": "No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today."}
{"prompt": "So do I.", "completion": "We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude."}
{"prompt": "It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.", "completion": "What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again."}
{"prompt": "I'm all right. I'm safe,", "completion": "What sort of task?"}
{"prompt": "I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.", "completion": "I thought I'd never see you again!"}
{"prompt": "They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.", "completion": "Do you know this man? Is there something between you?"}
{"prompt": "I've no choice", "completion": "If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!"}
{"prompt": "My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.", "completion": "But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?"}
{"prompt": "Victor. I love you,", "completion": "Elizabeth. My more than sister."}
{"prompt": "I give you my soul...", "completion": "...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join."}
{"prompt": "Our decision. Together.", "completion": "Your decision. For us."}
{"prompt": "You make me weak.", "completion": "Not as weak as I."}
{"prompt": "Only you.", "completion": "I will be here when you return."}
{"prompt": "Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.", "completion": "If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?"}
{"prompt": "I wish to be your husband.", "completion": "I wish to be your wife."}
{"prompt": "Is that what makes it so delicious?", "completion": "Brother and sister still?"}
{"prompt": "All my life I've known.", "completion": "This feels... incestuous."}
{"prompt": "To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...", "completion": "I've loved you all my life"}
{"prompt": "I'll have to do better than that.", "completion": "You will.  What do you want, Victor?"}
{"prompt": "And you?", "completion": "Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there."}
{"prompt": "Quite a send-off, isn't it?", "completion": "Father's so proud."}
{"prompt": "Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!", "completion": "Smell the air. Wonderful."}
{"prompt": "He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?", "completion": "Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!"}
{"prompt": "The world is a dizzying place.", "completion": "Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!"}
{"prompt": "He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother", "completion": "Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!"}
{"prompt": "She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.", "completion": "God took her from us."}
{"prompt": "It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.", "completion": "What kind of God is He to will this?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing can. Not ever.", "completion": "How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?"}
{"prompt": "Aren't you?", "completion": "Are you sure it can't hurt us?"}
{"prompt": "Aye, Captain.", "completion": "Don't cry, Elizabeth."}
{"prompt": "This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?", "completion": "He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin."}
{"prompt": "Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.", "completion": "A warming wind."}
{"prompt": "Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.", "completion": "They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now."}
{"prompt": "It's going to ram us.", "completion": "It wouldn't dare."}
{"prompt": "Professor?", "completion": "Oh God."}
{"prompt": "No. But someday.", "completion": "Thank goodness. We'd be out of work."}
{"prompt": "I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.", "completion": "Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?"}
{"prompt": "I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.", "completion": "You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?"}
{"prompt": "All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.", "completion": "Let it go."}
{"prompt": "Only if you'll tell me who he is.", "completion": "I owe you that. Done."}
{"prompt": "Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.", "completion": "I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together."}
{"prompt": "I didn't find what I was looking for.", "completion": "Are you sure you'll be all right?"}
{"prompt": "This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.", "completion": "What happened up there?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Henry.", "completion": "For what?"}
{"prompt": "Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?", "completion": "Quite a place."}
{"prompt": "It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.", "completion": "No. They don't."}
{"prompt": "Everything in moderation, Clerval.", "completion": "Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein."}
{"prompt": "You've been going round-the-clock?", "completion": "We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside."}
{"prompt": "Is that your diagnosis?", "completion": "Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now."}
{"prompt": "A... week?", "completion": "We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm."}
{"prompt": "You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.", "completion": "Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week."}
{"prompt": "Yes? And?", "completion": "Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can."}
{"prompt": "This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?", "completion": "Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down."}
{"prompt": "How much longer?", "completion": "Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now."}
{"prompt": "We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.", "completion": "That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory."}
{"prompt": "Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.", "completion": "I've been preoccupied."}
{"prompt": "No. He had more important work.", "completion": "There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that."}
{"prompt": "Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!", "completion": "All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!"}
{"prompt": "I resent God's monopoly.", "completion": "That's blasphemy!"}
{"prompt": "Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!", "completion": "You can't. Death is God's will!"}
{"prompt": "It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.", "completion": "You're making a scene!"}
{"prompt": "Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.", "completion": "Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying."}
{"prompt": "He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.", "completion": "They'll hang him all the same."}
{"prompt": "Nothing in moderation, Clerval.", "completion": "They just caught the man who did it."}
{"prompt": "Somebody has to!", "completion": "And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein."}
{"prompt": "But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.", "completion": "Only you would think of that!"}
{"prompt": "These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought", "completion": "...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before."}
{"prompt": "It's a letter to my father.", "completion": "Now you've got him started."}
{"prompt": "You're a comfort to me, Henry.", "completion": "What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help."}
{"prompt": "Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.", "completion": "The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss."}
{"prompt": "Can you think of a better reason?", "completion": "Quite a few."}
{"prompt": "Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.", "completion": "Rich old ladies and their daughters?"}
{"prompt": "I know. You have a way of making an impression.", "completion": "Do you really think I'm mad?"}
{"prompt": "Henry Clerval.", "completion": "Victor, Victor Frankenstein."}
{"prompt": "Are you having me on?", "completion": "Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane."}
{"prompt": "I am not mad.", "completion": "As a march hare."}
{"prompt": "I was just clearing my throat.", "completion": "Very well then."}
{"prompt": "So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?", "completion": "I have no knowledge of that."}
{"prompt": "Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?", "completion": "Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind."}
{"prompt": "And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?", "completion": "I have always loved him."}
{"prompt": "Despite the lack of challenge.", "completion": "Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer."}
{"prompt": "Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?", "completion": "You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum."}
{"prompt": "What is your name?", "completion": "Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva."}
{"prompt": "Paracelsus?", "completion": "Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa..."}
{"prompt": "Philosophical?", "completion": "Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one."}
{"prompt": "In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?", "completion": "But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works."}
{"prompt": "I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.", "completion": "Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor."}
{"prompt": "Victor. He was trying to be gracious.", "completion": "The strain was evident."}
{"prompt": "Re-configure the leads?", "completion": "Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste."}
{"prompt": "Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...", "completion": "\"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty."}
{"prompt": "It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.", "completion": "I doubt that decision is still mine to make."}
{"prompt": "Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.", "completion": "But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!"}
{"prompt": "Electricity.", "completion": "It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!"}
{"prompt": "Preposterous.", "completion": "I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since."}
{"prompt": "You disdain accepted wisdom?", "completion": "No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known."}
{"prompt": "You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.", "completion": "To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new."}
{"prompt": "Victor, explain yourself.", "completion": "Krempe has a way of provoking my temper."}
{"prompt": "My name is Frankenstein...", "completion": "Professor Waldman."}
{"prompt": "We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Do you share my madness?", "completion": "Madness?"}
{"prompt": "You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?", "completion": "Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on."}
{"prompt": "Your men are right to be afraid.", "completion": "Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune."}
{"prompt": "Creature? A... human like creature?", "completion": "You know of it?"}
{"prompt": "I heard.", "completion": "I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature."}
{"prompt": "Ah. An explorer.", "completion": "Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment."}
{"prompt": "How is it you come to be here?", "completion": "There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole."}
{"prompt": "Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.", "completion": "Are you a physician?"}
{"prompt": "You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.", "completion": "I'm... dying."}
{"prompt": "We should go now.", "completion": "Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy."}
{"prompt": "The killer is still out there.", "completion": "I will protect you."}
{"prompt": "So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?", "completion": "Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there..."}
{"prompt": "It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.", "completion": "No, no, they're all dead..."}
{"prompt": "It will be all right. I'll take care of you.", "completion": "Jack? Marcie? Ned?"}
{"prompt": "Good night, Brenda.", "completion": "He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God..."}
{"prompt": "I guess...", "completion": "Good night, Alice."}
{"prompt": "I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.", "completion": "Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway."}
{"prompt": "Melvin Belli.", "completion": "I was careless."}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow is another day.", "completion": "Right! Right!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.", "completion": "Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "What'd you see?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks, Alice.", "completion": "I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?"}
{"prompt": "You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.", "completion": "Next Friday."}
{"prompt": "You want to leave?", "completion": "I don't know. Probably be best for everybody."}
{"prompt": "Any particular reason?", "completion": "Just a feeling.  Nothing personal."}
{"prompt": "You draw very well.", "completion": "Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it."}
{"prompt": "That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?", "completion": "You told her to sweep the courts."}
{"prompt": "Cabin B is ready.", "completion": "Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push."}
{"prompt": "Why don't we run? Just run now?", "completion": "It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with it?", "completion": "Wet. I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Do you have a dime? A quarter?", "completion": "No. There must be some in the desk somewhere."}
{"prompt": "Hey, guys!", "completion": "It's dead. Try the pay phone."}
{"prompt": "Jack?", "completion": "Marcie?"}
{"prompt": "I'll go check on Brenda.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "They're off now."}
{"prompt": "I'll go take a look.", "completion": "Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?"}
{"prompt": "Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.", "completion": "It sounded like Brenda."}
{"prompt": "Absolutely.", "completion": "I don't hear it anymore."}
{"prompt": "Well, it hasn't been that long.", "completion": "Help you clean up?"}
{"prompt": "It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.", "completion": "Good point."}
{"prompt": "Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.", "completion": "Not if they're where I think they are."}
{"prompt": "Trouble?", "completion": "Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here."}
{"prompt": "How the... did he get in there?", "completion": "Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume."}
{"prompt": "You can only do what you can do.", "completion": "And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children..."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?", "completion": "Almost five."}
{"prompt": "What'll you do when you leave here?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "It still hurts?", "completion": "I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife."}
{"prompt": "Filmmaker.", "completion": "Artist."}
{"prompt": "And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.", "completion": "You're right. It makes no sense."}
{"prompt": "It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.", "completion": "Maybe I can help?"}
{"prompt": "You okay?", "completion": "How come you're leaving?"}
{"prompt": "Un-hunh.", "completion": "Oh, my God..."}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.", "completion": "Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?"}
{"prompt": "Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.", "completion": "You think you're gonna last all summer?"}
{"prompt": "I finished the boats.", "completion": "Alice? The others show up?"}
{"prompt": "You're welcome.", "completion": "Steve said for you to start on the boats."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?"}
{"prompt": "I'll be along.", "completion": "Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out..."}
{"prompt": "How come?", "completion": "Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed."}
{"prompt": "Let's go back, Barry...", "completion": "I need you so much, Claudette."}
{"prompt": "Somebody's there, Barry.", "completion": "Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone."}
{"prompt": "Somebody'll see.", "completion": "No, they won't..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you...", "completion": "Claudette..."}
{"prompt": "I can't, Barry...", "completion": "I wouldn't know."}
{"prompt": "I meant everything.", "completion": "You know what I said, though."}
{"prompt": "Where's Ned?", "completion": "You said we were special."}
{"prompt": "I'll spot you five points.", "completion": "You just had some lucky shots."}
{"prompt": "Get behind him more.", "completion": "Chance to get even?"}
{"prompt": "Is it stuck?", "completion": "Roll him over!"}
{"prompt": "A short somewhere.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.", "completion": "Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs."}
{"prompt": "I had to.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Don't get up. Take a second...", "completion": "You saved my life."}
{"prompt": "Here we go.", "completion": "I'll be okay. Holy shit..."}
{"prompt": "For sure.", "completion": "This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine."}
{"prompt": "Where'd you get that stuff?", "completion": "Give me a hand?"}
{"prompt": "Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was \"Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you.\" \"What hath God wrought\" was the telegraph.", "completion": "What the hell?"}
{"prompt": "What hath God wrought?", "completion": "That was the telephone."}
{"prompt": "No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?", "completion": "Whatever you make yourself."}
{"prompt": "Holy shit...", "completion": "We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want to be when you grow up?", "completion": "Dancer."}
{"prompt": "You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.", "completion": "God, but I love that sexy talk."}
{"prompt": "I don't believe you...", "completion": "Want to see my trick shot? It's even better."}
{"prompt": "God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.", "completion": "Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?"}
{"prompt": "Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.", "completion": "Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty."}
{"prompt": "Coach, athletic director somewhere.", "completion": "It's gonna be a long summer."}
{"prompt": "Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.", "completion": "Jack?"}
{"prompt": "I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.", "completion": "What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?"}
{"prompt": "Sometimes I only think about kissing women.", "completion": "Ow!"}
{"prompt": "Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.", "completion": "Ha!"}
{"prompt": "Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.", "completion": "Whassamatta?"}
{"prompt": "Best over...", "completion": "Umhummmmph."}
{"prompt": "Mmmmmmmph?", "completion": "Mmmmmmmph."}
{"prompt": "Are you wet?", "completion": "Just a little. Wait a minute, woman."}
{"prompt": "This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?", "completion": "Lead the way!"}
{"prompt": "It's just a dream.", "completion": "I call it my shower dream."}
{"prompt": "I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.", "completion": "You? The brick?"}
{"prompt": "I guess...", "completion": "Looks like a storm."}
{"prompt": "Don't call him.", "completion": "I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know."}
{"prompt": "He keeps on acting like such an asshole!", "completion": "Ned!"}
{"prompt": "What about Neddy?", "completion": "I don't love Neddy."}
{"prompt": "I love you.", "completion": "I love you."}
{"prompt": "Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.", "completion": "Makes me want to hold on and never let go."}
{"prompt": "Just a walk, for Chrissakes.", "completion": "Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you."}
{"prompt": "How about our last jay?", "completion": "Good call."}
{"prompt": "Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...", "completion": "But it's in the brochure! \"Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program.\" You just saw it."}
{"prompt": "You okay?", "completion": "Those things can be nasty."}
{"prompt": "Last line of Gone With the Wind?", "completion": "Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!"}
{"prompt": "Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?", "completion": "Rocky Road."}
{"prompt": "Girls can't be cowboys.", "completion": "Okay, Fireman."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.", "completion": "Cowboy."}
{"prompt": "There you are dead wrong.", "completion": "It's beautiful..."}
{"prompt": "For two lonely nights.", "completion": "Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.", "completion": "That's thirty percent."}
{"prompt": "I mean...", "completion": "...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone."}
{"prompt": "How much do I owe you?", "completion": "One night on the town."}
{"prompt": "I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.", "completion": "They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain."}
{"prompt": "I got to.", "completion": "Aw."}
{"prompt": "No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.", "completion": "You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Anything else you want?"}
{"prompt": "Good luck.", "completion": "Another coincidence."}
{"prompt": "Have to drop you here, Steve.", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.", "completion": "You've made a science out of coincidence."}
{"prompt": "I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Open the door. I'm coming aboard.", "completion": "I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!"}
{"prompt": "You said it was just you and your son.", "completion": "I meant me, my son and my daughter."}
{"prompt": "What was that?", "completion": "Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom."}
{"prompt": "What is your purpose in Mexico?", "completion": "Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight."}
{"prompt": "How many with you?", "completion": "Just my son and I."}
{"prompt": "So let's do it.", "completion": "Vamanos!"}
{"prompt": "So do I just follow you?", "completion": "Yeah, follow us."}
{"prompt": "I said new, this is an '90.", "completion": "It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.", "completion": "You like the car?"}
{"prompt": "You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.", "completion": "Twenty-eight."}
{"prompt": "Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.", "completion": "Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.", "completion": "I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?"}
{"prompt": "Have you ever been there before?", "completion": "No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning."}
{"prompt": "Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?", "completion": "I don't know, one place's as good as another."}
{"prompt": "To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!", "completion": "Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, son.", "completion": "Why did they block the door again?"}
{"prompt": "It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...", "completion": "Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name."}
{"prompt": "I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to \"go for it.\" I need your cover. Cover my ass.", "completion": "You don't believe in suicide."}
{"prompt": "Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.", "completion": "He's running the show."}
{"prompt": "Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.", "completion": "If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will."}
{"prompt": "What about Kate?", "completion": "They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance."}
{"prompt": "If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.", "completion": "Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance."}
{"prompt": "Have you forgotten about your sister?", "completion": "They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna try and get us across the border.", "completion": "No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there."}
{"prompt": "I have no idea.", "completion": "What are you gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.", "completion": "What's this guy's problem?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you want to stop?", "completion": "I'm exhausted."}
{"prompt": "Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?", "completion": "The truth hurts."}
{"prompt": "We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --", "completion": "Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?"}
{"prompt": "I promise.", "completion": "Kate, Scott?"}
{"prompt": "I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.", "completion": "Amen."}
{"prompt": "My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.", "completion": "Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did."}
{"prompt": "You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.", "completion": "What's this stuff?"}
{"prompt": "Yep.", "completion": "You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?", "completion": "Did he...?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.", "completion": "What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness."}
{"prompt": "In the Winnebago.", "completion": "In other words, no."}
{"prompt": "I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.", "completion": "Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about \"I don't believe in vampires\" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.", "completion": "You too, preacher?"}
{"prompt": "Forever together.", "completion": "Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?"}
{"prompt": "To yours.", "completion": "Now, is your shit together?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.", "completion": "To your family."}
{"prompt": "Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?", "completion": "What did you call me?"}
{"prompt": "Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.", "completion": "I never said do what I do, I said do what I say."}
{"prompt": "What are you going to do?", "completion": "I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head."}
{"prompt": "He backed down.", "completion": "He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', \"Fuck you Jack.\" I hear that loud and clear."}
{"prompt": "Why are you so agitated?", "completion": "I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too."}
{"prompt": "No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.", "completion": "Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?"}
{"prompt": "Pass.", "completion": "Why not, against your religion?"}
{"prompt": "Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.", "completion": "Who else?"}
{"prompt": "Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.", "completion": "Out of the stew pot and into the fire."}
{"prompt": "Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.", "completion": "Then?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.", "completion": "We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go."}
{"prompt": "As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?", "completion": "I don't have the slightest idea."}
{"prompt": "You best better get it done, Pops.", "completion": "I'm telling you, don't hurt her."}
{"prompt": "Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.", "completion": "I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico."}
{"prompt": "If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.", "completion": "Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!"}
{"prompt": "You won't let him touch her?", "completion": "I can handle Richie, don't worry."}
{"prompt": "No, I didn't.", "completion": "Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Didn't like it, did ya?"}
{"prompt": "You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.", "completion": "Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?"}
{"prompt": "How do I know you'll keep your word?", "completion": "Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy."}
{"prompt": "I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.", "completion": "I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Why'd ya quit?"}
{"prompt": "I was a minister.", "completion": "Was? As in not anymore?"}
{"prompt": "Real McCoy.", "completion": "You're a preacher?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, they do.", "completion": "Is this real?"}
{"prompt": "Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.", "completion": "Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?"}
{"prompt": "No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.", "completion": "Died instantly?"}
{"prompt": "Auto wreck.", "completion": "Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, she is.", "completion": "How'd she die?"}
{"prompt": "In heaven.", "completion": "She's dead?"}
{"prompt": "My wife.", "completion": "Where is the little lady?"}
{"prompt": "Scott and Kate.", "completion": "Who's this?"}
{"prompt": "Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.", "completion": "Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?"}
{"prompt": "That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, I need everybody.", "completion": "My children are not going with you, and that's that."}
{"prompt": "Come again?", "completion": "If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you."}
{"prompt": "Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.", "completion": "Not a chance."}
{"prompt": "Where are the keys to the motor home?", "completion": "On the dresser."}
{"prompt": "It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.", "completion": "Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!"}
{"prompt": "What's this about, money?", "completion": "It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance."}
{"prompt": "Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.", "completion": "Oh, well, excuse me all to hell."}
{"prompt": "He's my son.", "completion": "How does that happen? You don't look Japanese."}
{"prompt": "Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.", "completion": "What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?"}
{"prompt": "What's your name?", "completion": "Jacob."}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "Everybody goes home!"}
{"prompt": "Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...", "completion": "I'm going for 'em!"}
{"prompt": "Not good enough, swear to God.", "completion": "I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you."}
{"prompt": "Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...", "completion": "Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!"}
{"prompt": "I promise.", "completion": "Scott?"}
{"prompt": "You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?", "completion": "No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead."}
{"prompt": "About two hours from now.", "completion": "So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door."}
{"prompt": "It has a bed. That's all I care about.", "completion": "Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service..."}
{"prompt": "It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.", "completion": "If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing wrong with this place.", "completion": "It's a flop house."}
{"prompt": "What do you think Mom would say?", "completion": "Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead."}
{"prompt": "That happens, you'll get it back.", "completion": "Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore."}
{"prompt": "It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?", "completion": "I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore."}
{"prompt": "I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?", "completion": "Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?"}
{"prompt": "Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --", "completion": "That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting."}
{"prompt": "I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.", "completion": "Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim."}
{"prompt": "You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.", "completion": "Ain't it the truth."}
{"prompt": "You asked me if I would --", "completion": "It's the bitterest of pills."}
{"prompt": "What you said to me in the room.", "completion": "What did I say?"}
{"prompt": "In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.", "completion": "Do what?"}
{"prompt": "Mexicans.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Mexico.", "completion": "What's in Mexico?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Where are you taking us?"}
{"prompt": "Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "What's going on?", "completion": "We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won."}
{"prompt": "See ya.", "completion": "Later."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.", "completion": "Me too."}
{"prompt": "Should I use the last bullets on us?", "completion": "You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you."}
{"prompt": "Not many.", "completion": "Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper."}
{"prompt": "Anytime.", "completion": "How many bullets left, kid?"}
{"prompt": "Noooo!", "completion": "Watch my back!"}
{"prompt": "We have to go back for Daddy!", "completion": "Daddy's dead."}
{"prompt": "I'm really sorry.", "completion": "Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!"}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?", "completion": "Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory."}
{"prompt": "How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "You're gonna let us go?", "completion": "In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, \"Digayo.\" When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called \"The Titty Twister.\" From what I hear, you can't miss it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, we got a bible.", "completion": "Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You must have a bible in here, don't cha?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "You damn well better. Go."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Do you believe me?"}
{"prompt": "The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.", "completion": "You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?"}
{"prompt": "Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.", "completion": "Creepy guy."}
{"prompt": "-- you got your shower --", "completion": "-- see this, television!"}
{"prompt": "-- you got your microwave --", "completion": "-- you got your sink --"}
{"prompt": "I would say that's a very safe assumption.", "completion": "Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --"}
{"prompt": "This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.", "completion": "Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?"}
{"prompt": "We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.", "completion": "What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.", "completion": "Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?"}
{"prompt": "For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.", "completion": "Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?", "completion": "Six-fifty."}
{"prompt": "They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.", "completion": "Knock yourself out."}
{"prompt": "That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?", "completion": "Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage."}
{"prompt": "You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.", "completion": "What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?"}
{"prompt": "Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?", "completion": "Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?"}
{"prompt": "Whatsamatter?", "completion": "Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty."}
{"prompt": "I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.", "completion": "Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight."}
{"prompt": "Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.", "completion": "Not even for lunch?"}
{"prompt": "Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!", "completion": "Hot goddamn day!"}
{"prompt": "You callin' him a liar?", "completion": "I never said help us!"}
{"prompt": "He says you were scratching.", "completion": "I wasn't scratching!"}
{"prompt": "Were you giving that pig signals?", "completion": "What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!"}
{"prompt": "He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.", "completion": "I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to \"Benny's World of Blood.\""}
{"prompt": "What do you want from me? I did what you said.", "completion": "Letting him use your toilet? No store does that."}
{"prompt": "Best in Mexico.", "completion": "I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order."}
{"prompt": "Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?", "completion": "This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!"}
{"prompt": "What dya mean?", "completion": "This is a private club. You're not welcome."}
{"prompt": "Whiskey!", "completion": "You can't come in here."}
{"prompt": "How are you?", "completion": "Scarred for life, that's how I am!"}
{"prompt": "Well, then ask her, dumb ass.", "completion": "Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?"}
{"prompt": "Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "It don't look together.", "completion": "Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together."}
{"prompt": "No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.", "completion": "My shit is together."}
{"prompt": "Where are you?", "completion": "I'm here with you."}
{"prompt": "Where are you right now?", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "You're lookin' green.", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "You know what you look like?", "completion": "No, Richie, what do I look like?"}
{"prompt": "I'm lookin' scared?", "completion": "That's what you look like."}
{"prompt": "That's what you think?", "completion": "That's how you're lookin', Richie."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.", "completion": "It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit."}
{"prompt": "What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.", "completion": "When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!", "completion": "Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses."}
{"prompt": "Far out.  Where are my glasses?", "completion": "They broke when you fell."}
{"prompt": "We are?", "completion": "Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "We are...  \"South of the border down Mexico way.\""}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.", "completion": "Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?"}
{"prompt": "I did?", "completion": "Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I think so. What happened?", "completion": "I don't know, you just passed out."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?", "completion": "This ain't the time."}
{"prompt": "Keep your voice down.", "completion": "Or what?"}
{"prompt": "This ain't the time, Richard.", "completion": "Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks."}
{"prompt": "Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.", "completion": "You meant that, but you meant the other, too."}
{"prompt": "No, I didn't.", "completion": "Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You just called me a fuckin' nut."}
{"prompt": "As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.", "completion": "What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "Duly noted. Now, shut up.", "completion": "They're gonna search the van."}
{"prompt": "Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,", "completion": "I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "This isn't gonna work."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Seth, I understand.", "completion": "Richard!"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Yes, Seth, I understand."}
{"prompt": "Seth, if you were me --", "completion": "Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?"}
{"prompt": "It's not your fault, it's her fault!", "completion": "Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?"}
{"prompt": "Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.", "completion": "Is it me? Is it my fault?"}
{"prompt": "There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.", "completion": "No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck is she doin' there?!", "completion": "Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?"}
{"prompt": "What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?", "completion": "She's in the other room."}
{"prompt": "Where's the woman?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "How do you know?", "completion": "I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --"}
{"prompt": "Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.", "completion": "Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us."}
{"prompt": "They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.", "completion": "I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit."}
{"prompt": "Didya look at the border?", "completion": "Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?"}
{"prompt": "What'd ya see?", "completion": "Cops."}
{"prompt": "Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?", "completion": "Sight seein'."}
{"prompt": "All I'm saying --", "completion": "-- This conversation is over."}
{"prompt": "Did you even to try to negotiate?", "completion": "These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word \"barter\".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent."}
{"prompt": "Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.", "completion": "That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us."}
{"prompt": "Feels good.", "completion": "I'm gonna go get the money."}
{"prompt": "How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.", "completion": "I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?"}
{"prompt": "They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.", "completion": "How's it feel?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Do they have a waterbed?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Do they have an X-rated channel?"}
{"prompt": "He didn't recognize shit.", "completion": "Do they have cable?"}
{"prompt": "What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.", "completion": "What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us."}
{"prompt": "Gotcha!", "completion": "One... Two... Three."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!"}
{"prompt": "Richie? You okay?", "completion": "I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, \"Help us!\""}
{"prompt": "You believe me don't cha?", "completion": "Shut up and start the car."}
{"prompt": "Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:", "completion": "Start the car."}
{"prompt": "He signaled the Ranger.", "completion": "What the fuck is wrong with you --"}
{"prompt": "He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.", "completion": "What the fuck was that about?"}
{"prompt": "He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.", "completion": "He needs our help!"}
{"prompt": "You could take their head off.", "completion": "Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's mine.", "completion": "Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on."}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'll have one.", "completion": "In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours."}
{"prompt": "What'd you find, Kathy?", "completion": "How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?"}
{"prompt": "Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to \"See Addendum.\"  Checking...", "completion": "Wow..."}
{"prompt": "Got it.", "completion": "Who signed as his \"sponsoring officer\"?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.", "completion": "\"Wickwire, Thomas Dane.\"  See what you can find."}
{"prompt": "Who's...  Lieuten --", "completion": "Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?"}
{"prompt": "Administration, Ensign Blondell.", "completion": "Don't say my name."}
{"prompt": "But are there... I mean, how many...", "completion": "More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising."}
{"prompt": "The woman I saw you with...", "completion": "Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know."}
{"prompt": "I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, \"Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!\"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  \"Gee, I wish I were a man.\"", "completion": "I've been accused of that wish."}
{"prompt": "Who's \"we\"?", "completion": "Just some of the women."}
{"prompt": "That's what I hear.", "completion": "Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious."}
{"prompt": "No problem, lieutenant.", "completion": "They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half."}
{"prompt": "B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.", "completion": "Thank you, ensign."}
{"prompt": "Of course, but there's more --", "completion": "Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now..."}
{"prompt": "Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.", "completion": "\"Security\"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?"}
{"prompt": "Standing right here in my office.", "completion": "Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?"}
{"prompt": "Your prerogative, Senator.", "completion": "Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?"}
{"prompt": "Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.", "completion": "Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  \"Midnight Mahogany\"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here."}
{"prompt": "-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this \"G.I. Jane\" thing.", "completion": "-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution."}
{"prompt": "Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --", "completion": "Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --"}
{"prompt": "Sir?  What did he say?", "completion": "Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell."}
{"prompt": "Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?", "completion": "Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'."}
{"prompt": "Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?", "completion": "I'm not sure what --"}
{"prompt": "Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...", "completion": "I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed."}
{"prompt": "I'm saying, we're just friends.", "completion": "I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself."}
{"prompt": "I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  \"... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming.\"", "completion": "Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong."}
{"prompt": "Permission to leave, sir?", "completion": "Permission to evaporate, O'Neil."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --", "completion": "\"We'll all have lunch.\"  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!"}
{"prompt": "See me, sir?", "completion": "You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?"}
{"prompt": "So I'll get a fair shot?", "completion": "You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get."}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't dream of it, sir.", "completion": "Then good night."}
{"prompt": "Across the board, sir.", "completion": "And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular."}
{"prompt": "Same rules for everyone, sir.", "completion": "Straight up?"}
{"prompt": "The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.", "completion": "Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?"}
{"prompt": "No, sir.", "completion": "No, sir, WHAT?"}
{"prompt": "I think you've resented me from the start, sir.", "completion": "What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?"}
{"prompt": "Pardon?", "completion": "Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home."}
{"prompt": "I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- \"Yeah, she made it, but...\"  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?", "completion": "Did you just have a brain-fart?"}
{"prompt": "It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.", "completion": "Because I was civil, now you're complaining."}
{"prompt": "It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.", "completion": "Oh, really."}
{"prompt": "Didn't take long.", "completion": "All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?"}
{"prompt": "If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.", "completion": "Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way."}
{"prompt": "Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.", "completion": "Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect."}
{"prompt": "I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?", "completion": "None at this time, sir."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.", "completion": "Really, I have no problem with --"}
{"prompt": "Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.", "completion": "Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --"}
{"prompt": "I'm fine, sir.", "completion": "So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, sir.", "completion": "Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?"}
{"prompt": "West?", "completion": "Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant..."}
{"prompt": "Newberry, get a photo.  South?", "completion": "Entering my scan now..."}
{"prompt": "Fine by me, sir!", "completion": "No problem, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Ah, c'mon...", "completion": "Motherachrist..."}
{"prompt": "Aw, what is this...", "completion": "Sir..."}
{"prompt": "What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?", "completion": "O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!", "completion": "Fuck me."}
{"prompt": "Only blanks.  Lemme do it.", "completion": "Hey.  Ain't your call, man."}
{"prompt": "Smoke her.", "completion": "I ain't gonna shoot her."}
{"prompt": "Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.", "completion": "Shit.  Think we're had."}
{"prompt": "Did you hear?", "completion": "She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --"}
{"prompt": "Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I'll act surprised.", "completion": "Think I overplayed it?"}
{"prompt": "That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.", "completion": "White House boys want a private meeting."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.", "completion": "The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was \"pilot error,\" hmm?", "completion": "I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --"}
{"prompt": "The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?", "completion": "I was one member of the investigating commission."}
{"prompt": "\"The Lark Report.\"", "completion": "Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --"}
{"prompt": "Hardly the case, Senator.", "completion": "Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point..."}
{"prompt": "... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --", "completion": "Whoa, whoa, whoa.  \"Land-based maritime specialties.\" Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that..."}
{"prompt": "You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.", "completion": "Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure it is.", "completion": "You'll think about my offer?"}
{"prompt": "You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?", "completion": "I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable."}
{"prompt": "I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.", "completion": "I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team."}
{"prompt": "So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.", "completion": "The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --"}
{"prompt": "You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.", "completion": "Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory."}
{"prompt": "What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?", "completion": "I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags."}
{"prompt": "You don't know that.", "completion": "In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same."}
{"prompt": "So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?", "completion": "What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way."}
{"prompt": "Should probably ask him that.", "completion": "If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras."}
{"prompt": "Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.", "completion": "What changed?"}
{"prompt": "Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?", "completion": "Absolutely not."}
{"prompt": "It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.", "completion": "Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --"}
{"prompt": "You know him.", "completion": "Sounds familiar."}
{"prompt": "Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --", "completion": "Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire."}
{"prompt": "Uh, ma'am.", "completion": "Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base."}
{"prompt": "Can't complain, ma'am.", "completion": "Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person."}
{"prompt": "Would I be the only one?  The only woman?", "completion": "There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now..."}
{"prompt": "Uh, question, ma'am.", "completion": "Yes, dear."}
{"prompt": "Captain Dwyer.  Technically.", "completion": "My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now..."}
{"prompt": "I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?", "completion": "This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?"}
{"prompt": "\"Coronado.\"", "completion": "California."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?", "completion": "High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote."}
{"prompt": "\"G.I. Jane.\"  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?", "completion": "So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside."}
{"prompt": "What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?", "completion": "I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly."}
{"prompt": "Then I suggest we start there.", "completion": "Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is."}
{"prompt": "So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?", "completion": "I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men."}
{"prompt": "Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!", "completion": "Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over."}
{"prompt": "Close as I can get, el-tee!", "completion": "Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!"}
{"prompt": "Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.", "completion": "Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix..."}
{"prompt": "Hey.  You okay, Flea?", "completion": "'Snot me.  It's him."}
{"prompt": "I'll work on it, ma'am.", "completion": "Do that."}
{"prompt": "No, ma'am.", "completion": "Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?"}
{"prompt": "It's really \"F. Lee Montgomery\" -- but that gets whittled down to just \"Flea.\"  For short, ma'am.", "completion": "So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?"}
{"prompt": "You're wanted at the C.O.'s.", "completion": "Montgomery, why do they call you \"Flea\"?"}
{"prompt": "O'Neil?", "completion": "Sir?"}
{"prompt": "Come on, Montgomery...", "completion": "Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?"}
{"prompt": "Just do it, okay?", "completion": "If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!"}
{"prompt": "I can make this wall without --", "completion": "... two... one... MARK!"}
{"prompt": "I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.", "completion": "Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three..."}
{"prompt": "Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.", "completion": "I oughtta report you."}
{"prompt": "She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.", "completion": "She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback."}
{"prompt": "I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.", "completion": "She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?"}
{"prompt": "You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?", "completion": "You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count."}
{"prompt": "Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.", "completion": "Get it up!"}
{"prompt": "Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.", "completion": "Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different."}
{"prompt": "Time.", "completion": "Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast."}
{"prompt": "Just a coincidence?", "completion": "Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone."}
{"prompt": "I was looking for him earlier, but...", "completion": "The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy."}
{"prompt": "The Navy Cross...", "completion": "I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point."}
{"prompt": "Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called \"gender-norming,\" O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?", "completion": "What \"all females\"?  If I'm the only --"}
{"prompt": "I'll try anyway, sir.", "completion": "You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.", "completion": "Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil."}
{"prompt": "Which is guy-speak for...", "completion": "\"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long.\""}
{"prompt": "So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.", "completion": "Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined."}
{"prompt": "I'd sure like to know who.", "completion": "Yeah.  Me too."}
{"prompt": "\"Wickwire, Thomas Dane\"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the \"Appropriation Liaison Office,\" whatever that is.", "completion": "You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado..."}
{"prompt": "Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.", "completion": "\"In Washington...\""}
{"prompt": "Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.", "completion": "I don't know, I don't care."}
{"prompt": "Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?", "completion": "Sounds like an amazing coincidence."}
{"prompt": "\"John James Urgayle.\"  The Chief.", "completion": "What about him."}
{"prompt": "I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?", "completion": "Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork."}
{"prompt": "It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.", "completion": "Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?"}
{"prompt": "The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?", "completion": "C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me."}
{"prompt": "Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?", "completion": "No shortage of suspects."}
{"prompt": "And this class officer... \"Wickwire.\"  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...", "completion": "Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.  I'll join the crowd.", "completion": "All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay."}
{"prompt": "Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.", "completion": "Jordan.  You watch your ass."}
{"prompt": "Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?", "completion": "That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't..."}
{"prompt": "You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.", "completion": "I'm only trying to warn you in case --"}
{"prompt": "So why are you telling me this?", "completion": "Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you."}
{"prompt": "I saw an article...", "completion": "I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about \"G.I. Jane.\"  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster."}
{"prompt": "Me?  Why me?", "completion": "Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?"}
{"prompt": "I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?", "completion": "Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn."}
{"prompt": "How hard they making it on you?", "completion": "That bad?"}
{"prompt": "I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?", "completion": "It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life."}
{"prompt": "Jordan...", "completion": "Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much."}
{"prompt": "Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.", "completion": "You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know."}
{"prompt": "I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.", "completion": "Which is guy-speak for..."}
{"prompt": "I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --", "completion": "Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?"}
{"prompt": "You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.", "completion": "Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?"}
{"prompt": "Well, guess I don't even need to be here...", "completion": "Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you."}
{"prompt": "So dump on me.", "completion": "This has nothing to do with you."}
{"prompt": "She's haze grey and underway...", "completion": "You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling."}
{"prompt": "Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.", "completion": "Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?"}
{"prompt": "Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.", "completion": "I take it you don't either.  Feet."}
{"prompt": "So why're you even considering it? Are you?", "completion": "Just like you would be."}
{"prompt": "By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?", "completion": "Is this my glory, sir?"}
{"prompt": "Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.", "completion": "Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?", "completion": "Probably hear back from CNN first."}
{"prompt": "Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?", "completion": "That was good headwork, lieutenant."}
{"prompt": "Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.", "completion": "You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?"}
{"prompt": "Unless you Whiskey Run.", "completion": "Blank faces here, O'Neil."}
{"prompt": "North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?", "completion": "Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out."}
{"prompt": "Chances of recovery?", "completion": "You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze."}
{"prompt": "Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?", "completion": "Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries."}
{"prompt": "Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?", "completion": "Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?"}
{"prompt": "This is insane.  You've got no proof.", "completion": "Lieutenant O'Neil."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.", "completion": "I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations."}
{"prompt": "Sure, sure.", "completion": "We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...", "completion": "Do you, uh, know..."}
{"prompt": "I can't go out.  Not like this.", "completion": "I think you look beautiful."}
{"prompt": "First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.", "completion": "Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, didn't mean to --", "completion": "That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why."}
{"prompt": "Last time I didn't.", "completion": "Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me..."}
{"prompt": "O'Neil?", "completion": "How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?"}
{"prompt": "You got anybody, Wick?", "completion": "Not me.  You?"}
{"prompt": "He was married?", "completion": "At first."}
{"prompt": "That's a good story.", "completion": "So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything."}
{"prompt": "They had to kill 'em?", "completion": "Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted."}
{"prompt": "If you got a good one, Wick...", "completion": "One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts."}
{"prompt": "You really came back for more?  Of this?", "completion": "When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell..."}
{"prompt": "Wick.  They got your crew, too?", "completion": "Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit."}
{"prompt": "Who is it?", "completion": "You know, I had an apartment about this size once."}
{"prompt": "Hey.  Way to gut it out.", "completion": "Thanks, Wick."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.", "completion": "You're kind of a surprise yourself."}
{"prompt": "And how do you know that?", "completion": "Made it to Week 10 last time."}
{"prompt": "Whose orders were those?", "completion": "It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half."}
{"prompt": "Well, now I feel so much better.", "completion": "It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway."}
{"prompt": "Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.", "completion": "They're more afraid of you."}
{"prompt": "So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?", "completion": "Maybe half.  Not even."}
{"prompt": "'Cool?", "completion": "Smoke it!"}
{"prompt": "32 feet, six inches!", "completion": "I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!"}
{"prompt": "If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?", "completion": "Mighta been civilian."}
{"prompt": "She part of the training?", "completion": "I don't know..."}
{"prompt": "Just askin'", "completion": "What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --"}
{"prompt": "Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.", "completion": "What're you guys doing?  Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Show us where you are, Chief.", "completion": "O'Neil..."}
{"prompt": "15, sir.", "completion": "Got it."}
{"prompt": "Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.", "completion": "Say again?  How many micks?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.", "completion": "Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.", "completion": "Good to see you again, too, sir."}
{"prompt": "Sure.  Just like your men do.", "completion": "I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect."}
{"prompt": "I'm so glad we agree.", "completion": "Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?"}
{"prompt": "Do you?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.", "completion": "You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?"}
{"prompt": "I think you're the liar.", "completion": "I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --"}
{"prompt": "That's not right.", "completion": "That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?"}
{"prompt": "No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --", "completion": "The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --"}
{"prompt": "She led us right to you.  That's no threat?", "completion": "Would you have shot if it was a man?"}
{"prompt": "Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?", "completion": "Wasn't deemed a threat."}
{"prompt": "Should I be afraid?", "completion": "Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.", "completion": "You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now."}
{"prompt": "Dick, Jane, and Spot.", "completion": "Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you."}
{"prompt": "\"Dad.\"", "completion": "Any brothers?  Sisters?"}
{"prompt": "You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.", "completion": "Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?"}
{"prompt": "England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.", "completion": "McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s."}
{"prompt": "Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.", "completion": "It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead."}
{"prompt": "I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.", "completion": "Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?"}
{"prompt": "Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?", "completion": "For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia."}
{"prompt": "Permission to get dressed, sir?", "completion": "It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore."}
{"prompt": "Chief, sir, I don't understand why --", "completion": "Educate her, Pyro."}
{"prompt": "Say again, sir?", "completion": "You heard me.  Move on."}
{"prompt": "Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.", "completion": "Shut your hole, Slutnik."}
{"prompt": "You don't suppose this is just part of...", "completion": "FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?"}
{"prompt": "I just wonder how that happened.", "completion": "Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing."}
{"prompt": "Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.", "completion": "MOVE!"}
{"prompt": "North?", "completion": "All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.", "completion": "Clear."}
{"prompt": "That your desk?  I'll take this one.", "completion": "WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?"}
{"prompt": "Funny, the C.O. says I can.", "completion": "Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there."}
{"prompt": "Anybody usin' these drawers here?", "completion": "Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me."}
{"prompt": "Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?", "completion": "Your new roommate."}
{"prompt": "What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?", "completion": "This ain't even workin' wrong!"}
{"prompt": "So am I.", "completion": "This ain't workin' right!"}
{"prompt": "Somebody throw a tent over this circus.", "completion": "You mind?  I'm trying to eat here."}
{"prompt": "We are so fucked.", "completion": "Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?"}
{"prompt": "We're fucked.", "completion": "Darth Vader reads poetry..."}
{"prompt": "I don't...  What, someone on base?  A \"mole\"?", "completion": "This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable."}
{"prompt": "Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?", "completion": "Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there."}
{"prompt": "Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...", "completion": "I take it this file is still open."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  Seems...", "completion": "This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond."}
{"prompt": "Women.", "completion": "If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?"}
{"prompt": "The first female President?", "completion": "Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  \"G.I. Jane\" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all."}
{"prompt": "Hmm.  Let's aim higher.", "completion": "The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man."}
{"prompt": "Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?", "completion": "Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven."}
{"prompt": "Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.", "completion": "The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?"}
{"prompt": "All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?", "completion": "The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe."}
{"prompt": "You knew about us?", "completion": "Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew."}
{"prompt": "O'Neil, Jordan.", "completion": "Thought you two were file-closed."}
{"prompt": "Go in there. Talk to her.", "completion": "Subject?"}
{"prompt": "All that \"you gotta be vicious\" stuff you filled her head with.", "completion": "Me!? You where the one..."}
{"prompt": "In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.", "completion": "Where's Audrey?"}
{"prompt": "Great. See ya then.", "completion": "Who the hell are all these people?"}
{"prompt": "Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.", "completion": "Audrey's going to stay with us tonight."}
{"prompt": "I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...", "completion": "Hey, hey! I'm eating here!"}
{"prompt": "Shut up. How can you eat like that?", "completion": "Big bites."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "That's cuz I'm married to you."}
{"prompt": "But we can get to the west side faster.", "completion": "Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?"}
{"prompt": "The JFK? In the rain!?", "completion": "What are you talking about? The east side is always faster."}
{"prompt": "Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.", "completion": "You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK."}
{"prompt": "He's not going to do it.", "completion": "Oh yes he will."}
{"prompt": "Think we can fit up in there?", "completion": "Only one way to find out."}
{"prompt": "Don't you think we have enough?", "completion": "Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "Lucy'd kill me if she knew."}
{"prompt": "Animal, I can't.", "completion": "Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance."}
{"prompt": "My God. He's going after the nest.", "completion": "Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Why are you asking?", "completion": "I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.", "completion": "Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?"}
{"prompt": "It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.", "completion": "You made a mistake."}
{"prompt": "We know, Audrey.", "completion": "You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.", "completion": "He stole my report! That's my report!"}
{"prompt": "Nearly four years...", "completion": "Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?"}
{"prompt": "No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...", "completion": "How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I can be tough if I want.", "completion": "That why you dumped him?"}
{"prompt": "Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?", "completion": "Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle."}
{"prompt": "I like that image.", "completion": "You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog."}
{"prompt": "Who was that French guy, anyway.", "completion": "Oh, just some insurance guy."}
{"prompt": "You'd be surprised.", "completion": "Really? I'd like to find out."}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?", "completion": "Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting."}
{"prompt": "If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.", "completion": "Oh my God! They're coming!"}
{"prompt": "The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.", "completion": "Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did."}
{"prompt": "How do you know?", "completion": "Our network covers the Ranger games."}
{"prompt": "I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.", "completion": "Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here."}
{"prompt": "I was wrong.", "completion": "Circuits are overloaded."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing here?", "completion": "I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs."}
{"prompt": "I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.", "completion": "So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?"}
{"prompt": "You never said it was off the record.", "completion": "I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you."}
{"prompt": "Is this cause of me? Because of the story?", "completion": "Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?"}
{"prompt": "Nesting?", "completion": "Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!"}
{"prompt": "I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?", "completion": "The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure?", "completion": "Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy."}
{"prompt": "What else do you know about it?", "completion": "...he's pregnant."}
{"prompt": "Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?", "completion": "I got pretty close."}
{"prompt": "And you think this creature is one of them?", "completion": "Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening..."}
{"prompt": "And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?", "completion": "I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature."}
{"prompt": "I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?", "completion": "When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism."}
{"prompt": "Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?", "completion": "Sure. I'd like that."}
{"prompt": "Most people don't.", "completion": "I'm sorry you feel that way."}
{"prompt": "You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.", "completion": "That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real \"boring\" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...", "completion": "You're still mad at me, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well...", "completion": "So, you still picking apart cockroaches?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am."}
{"prompt": "It's good to see you, Nick.", "completion": "So you made it."}
{"prompt": "You must have quite some harem.", "completion": "Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?"}
{"prompt": "I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.", "completion": "I'll take them all."}
{"prompt": "Wish me luck!", "completion": "Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?", "completion": "I left my forgery kit back at the office."}
{"prompt": "Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?", "completion": "Your old sweetheart?"}
{"prompt": "That's the problem. He did.", "completion": "What the hell are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "Nick Tatopoulos.", "completion": "Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him."}
{"prompt": "He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.", "completion": "Did Romeo have a name?"}
{"prompt": "It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!", "completion": "Who is he?"}
{"prompt": "I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.", "completion": "He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk."}
{"prompt": "My life sucks.", "completion": "Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks."}
{"prompt": "And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.", "completion": "Speak of the devil."}
{"prompt": "Five bucks.", "completion": "You're kidding, right?"}
{"prompt": "What do I get?", "completion": "The warm feeling of helping your fellow man."}
{"prompt": "What's it to you?", "completion": "Can I use some?"}
{"prompt": "Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.", "completion": "Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?"}
{"prompt": "We? I don't think so.", "completion": "I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me."}
{"prompt": "Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?", "completion": "We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!"}
{"prompt": "Not now. You got my bag?", "completion": "You don't understand, I can get us information..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military..."}
{"prompt": "It's your choice.", "completion": "Caiman, wait. Take me with you."}
{"prompt": "So have dinner with me tonight.", "completion": "I can't."}
{"prompt": "Call me Charlie.", "completion": "Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace."}
{"prompt": "And you're beautiful...", "completion": "Mr. Caiman..."}
{"prompt": "Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?", "completion": "Mr. Caiman, you're married."}
{"prompt": "Just tell me, did you talk with him?", "completion": "He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez."}
{"prompt": "Did you talk with Humphries?", "completion": "This is not the place..."}
{"prompt": "Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.", "completion": "I'll try."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry about all this.", "completion": "Me too."}
{"prompt": "Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?", "completion": "I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "Hence the radiation.", "completion": "More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region."}
{"prompt": "Well, I think you're cute.", "completion": "Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?"}
{"prompt": "You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?", "completion": "Not for a long time, now."}
{"prompt": "Really? A girlfriend then?", "completion": "No. Perhaps I work too much."}
{"prompt": "Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?", "completion": "Oh, I'm not married."}
{"prompt": "Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...", "completion": "Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist."}
{"prompt": "They didn't make it.", "completion": "Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!"}
{"prompt": "We've secured the doors on both levels.", "completion": "Where's Luc and Pierre?"}
{"prompt": "They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.", "completion": "That is when we will go in."}
{"prompt": "Merde!", "completion": "Allez, allez!"}
{"prompt": "And how should we do that, Sir?", "completion": "Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!"}
{"prompt": "Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.", "completion": "Have them sealed off."}
{"prompt": "When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.", "completion": "Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?"}
{"prompt": "Major, what do you think could have done this?", "completion": "Get your people out of there or I will."}
{"prompt": "That is our job.", "completion": "Well your people are getting in the way of my job."}
{"prompt": "CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.", "completion": "You're fast."}
{"prompt": "Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.", "completion": "They are with me!"}
{"prompt": "You gave them the tape?", "completion": "No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it."}
{"prompt": "So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.", "completion": "It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly."}
{"prompt": "Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.", "completion": "No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population."}
{"prompt": "Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.", "completion": "You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking..."}
{"prompt": "What are you suggesting?", "completion": "When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out."}
{"prompt": "What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.", "completion": "You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal."}
{"prompt": "The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.", "completion": "Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is."}
{"prompt": "Somebody must have seen it.", "completion": "It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over."}
{"prompt": "But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?", "completion": "We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out."}
{"prompt": "That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.", "completion": "That's right."}
{"prompt": "What sample?", "completion": "You're standing on it."}
{"prompt": "They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.", "completion": "Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it."}
{"prompt": "It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?", "completion": "Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big."}
{"prompt": "The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?", "completion": "No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out."}
{"prompt": "Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?", "completion": "Yeah, you're the worm guy."}

{"prompt": "The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.", "completion": "That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved."}

{"prompt": "There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.", "completion": "Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt."}
{"prompt": "There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!", "completion": "That can't be."}
{"prompt": "They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.", "completion": "Same old story."}
{"prompt": "While they're strung out?", "completion": "Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half."}

Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?"}
{"prompt": "I hope I never have to believe that.", "completion": "Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!"}
{"prompt": "Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.", "completion": "Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'."}

{"prompt": "Is that a fact.", "completion": "It is."}
{"prompt": "Go on... I want to hear everything.", "completion": "Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee."}
{"prompt": "We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.", "completion": "The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief."}
{"prompt": "They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.", "completion": "But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?"}

{"prompt": "Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.", "completion": "Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it..."}
{"prompt": "Arnold!", "completion": "I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!"}
{"prompt": "Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?", "completion": "It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation."}
{"prompt": "They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.", "completion": "And a French alliance?"}
{"prompt": "What's your frank estimation of the British?", "completion": "Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?"}
{"prompt": "You seem pleased by the prospect.", "completion": "Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!"}

But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...", "completion": "I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring."}

{"prompt": "I ain't forgot about the freedom.", "completion": "Well, what have you thought?"}

{"prompt": "Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?", "completion": "No.  I guess."}
{"prompt": "You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.", "completion": "Yes, general."}

{"prompt": "Me?  You apologizing to me?", "completion": "Yes, William.  I am apologizing."}
{"prompt": "What?  What are you talking about?", "completion": "That you would have known you can trust me."}

{"prompt": "Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.", "completion": "Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, my lord.", "completion": "And, is that a pitchfork beside him?"}
{"prompt": "No, my lord.", "completion": "What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?"}
{"prompt": "Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...", "completion": "No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?"}
{"prompt": "Who is that!?", "completion": "That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation."}

{"prompt": "But it's more than just that, am I right?", "completion": "That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure.", "completion": "George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them."}
{"prompt": "Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.", "completion": "Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?"}
{"prompt": "I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?", "completion": "Yes, I believe so."}
{"prompt": "What's your advice, Alexander?", "completion": "March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!"}
{"prompt": "He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.", "completion": "Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?"}
{"prompt": "George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?", "completion": "To hell with Arnold..."}
{"prompt": "This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?", "completion": "No one knows..."}

{"prompt": "Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...", "completion": "Sir, Arnold is a traitor."}
{"prompt": "Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!", "completion": "Sir, I think no such thing."}
{"prompt": "Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.", "completion": "Yessir."}
{"prompt": "Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.", "completion": "General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here."}
{"prompt": "They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.", "completion": "What are we going to do?"}
{"prompt": "We better, Congress invented him.", "completion": "It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating."}
{"prompt": "To learn to shoot cannon?", "completion": "Are you going to keep him, sir?"}
{"prompt": "It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.", "completion": "I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College."}
{"prompt": "But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  \"I regret that I have but one life to give to my country.\"", "completion": "They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers."}
{"prompt": "With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?", "completion": "That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy."}
{"prompt": "And is that the most horrible thing in the world?", "completion": "Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on."}
{"prompt": "Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.", "completion": "General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?"}
{"prompt": "Therefore, retreat.", "completion": "I'm so inclined."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?", "completion": "No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact."}
{"prompt": "I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.", "completion": "Delighted, sir."}
{"prompt": "How old are you, Captain?", "completion": "I'll be twenty next year, sir."}
{"prompt": "We've got powder but no ball!", "completion": "Then use rocks!"}
{"prompt": "Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!", "completion": "Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross."}
{"prompt": "Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.", "completion": "George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army."}
{"prompt": "The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.", "completion": "Who's in command out there?"}
{"prompt": "Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.", "completion": "Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?"}
{"prompt": "They are... friends of Congress.", "completion": "Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?"}
{"prompt": "George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...", "completion": "Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?"}
{"prompt": "Lafayette is a child!", "completion": "Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down."}
{"prompt": "I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.", "completion": "If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...", "completion": "Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation."}
{"prompt": "As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.", "completion": "You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment."}
{"prompt": "Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.", "completion": "With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts."}
{"prompt": "It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.", "completion": "Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift."}
{"prompt": "Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?", "completion": "Partially..."}
{"prompt": "No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.", "completion": "Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!"}
{"prompt": "You think that?", "completion": "He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, come now...", "completion": "You invented this, this..."}
{"prompt": "Makes you gag.", "completion": "Gag on your own invention, then."}
{"prompt": "Let's not over do it...", "completion": "I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  \"General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!\"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!"}
{"prompt": "He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.", "completion": "Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!"}
{"prompt": "What's the difference?", "completion": "Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!"}
{"prompt": "We already have black soldiers in our army...", "completion": "Unofficially, General Greene."}
{"prompt": "The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.", "completion": "Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!"}
{"prompt": "Detained by what?", "completion": "The British army, sir!"}
{"prompt": "I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?", "completion": "General Lee is detained captain..."}
{"prompt": "These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.", "completion": "No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress."}
{"prompt": "If he isn't, then he's stupid.", "completion": "Did God ever make such a pitiful army?"}
{"prompt": "Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!", "completion": "I doubt Arnold will be afraid."}
{"prompt": "Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!", "completion": "Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!"}
{"prompt": "The man is a traitor!", "completion": "How can you say that?"}
{"prompt": "Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...", "completion": "Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold."}
{"prompt": "They help me understand why we fight.", "completion": "Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!"}
{"prompt": "How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!", "completion": "And, Hamilton?  Greene?"}
{"prompt": "They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...", "completion": "George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold..."}
{"prompt": "No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?", "completion": "But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...", "completion": "I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that."}
{"prompt": "No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.", "completion": "To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!"}
{"prompt": "A grand scheme?", "completion": "A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?"}
{"prompt": "Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.", "completion": "Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man."}
{"prompt": "George!  So good to be back!", "completion": "That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable."}
{"prompt": "I understand, George.", "completion": "Colonel Reed..."}
{"prompt": "What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.", "completion": "If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them."}
{"prompt": "A fleet?", "completion": "My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there."}
{"prompt": "Any word from Canada?", "completion": "Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain..."}
{"prompt": "I feel the same, sir.", "completion": "I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York."}
{"prompt": "General Lee, sir!", "completion": "Get these men back in line!"}
{"prompt": "My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...", "completion": "My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!"}
{"prompt": "When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.", "completion": "What is it, Marquis?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.", "completion": "Like flowers after the snow melts."}
{"prompt": "Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.", "completion": "Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad."}
{"prompt": "Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.", "completion": "I rode here, on my horse."}
{"prompt": "And how rusty are these muskets?", "completion": "Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!"}
{"prompt": "These supplies...?", "completion": "Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets."}
{"prompt": "'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.", "completion": "I only meant..."}
{"prompt": "You must be very rich.", "completion": "I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies..."}
{"prompt": "No, please; an advance on your salary.", "completion": "Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary."}
{"prompt": "I... they look both the same.", "completion": "The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit."}
{"prompt": "Uh... none just now, but...", "completion": "'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?"}
{"prompt": "What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?", "completion": "Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?"}
{"prompt": "But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.", "completion": "Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette..."}
{"prompt": "However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!", "completion": "We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with."}
{"prompt": "I want you to see our hospital.", "completion": "I don't want to see your hospital."}
{"prompt": "Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.", "completion": "Not today."}
{"prompt": "Martha!  For God's sake!", "completion": "Leave me, now sir, I am tired."}
{"prompt": "Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!", "completion": "Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them."}
{"prompt": "Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!", "completion": "Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind..."}
{"prompt": "What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?", "completion": "Some things must never change."}
{"prompt": "To win this war I need an army.", "completion": "Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?"}
{"prompt": "Martha... what?", "completion": "Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests."}
{"prompt": "What else?  From Virginia?", "completion": "Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now."}
{"prompt": "I think I heard that.", "completion": "It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!"}
{"prompt": "And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.", "completion": "Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?"}
{"prompt": "That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...", "completion": "That's right..."}
{"prompt": "When you lived with the Fairfaxes?", "completion": "When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then..."}
{"prompt": "You're no fool, George.  You never have been.", "completion": "\"Liberty, Virtue, Country\"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days..."}
{"prompt": "Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.", "completion": "But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me."}
{"prompt": "The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.", "completion": "And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.", "completion": "Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory."}
{"prompt": "I'm very aware of that.", "completion": "I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed..."}
{"prompt": "The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.", "completion": "Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as..."}
{"prompt": "Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...", "completion": "My God, what?"}
{"prompt": "Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.", "completion": "But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise."}
{"prompt": "Surely you knew this was coming.", "completion": "War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!"}
{"prompt": "It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.", "completion": "My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it."}
{"prompt": "If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.", "completion": "You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government."}
{"prompt": "Well, this must be about something!", "completion": "It is; we need you George."}
{"prompt": "They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?", "completion": "Yes sir, it's a wise idea..."}
{"prompt": "I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.", "completion": "Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform..."}
{"prompt": "You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!", "completion": "Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him."}
{"prompt": "Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...", "completion": "What the hell are we doing?"}
{"prompt": "But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.", "completion": "At one time I could have chosen not to be."}
{"prompt": "No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.", "completion": "I will not betray you, Nathanael."}
{"prompt": "Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.", "completion": "You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?"}
{"prompt": "They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.", "completion": "You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton."}
{"prompt": "I'm with Captain Hamilton.", "completion": "Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael."}
{"prompt": "You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.", "completion": "General Greene?"}
{"prompt": "Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.", "completion": "I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman."}
{"prompt": "Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?", "completion": "Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.", "completion": "The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!"}
{"prompt": "I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.", "completion": "A horseshoer?"}
{"prompt": "I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...", "completion": "But, you do come from a military family?"}
{"prompt": "I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.", "completion": "It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?"}
{"prompt": "Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.", "completion": "Yes, yes, happy to meet you."}
{"prompt": "They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!", "completion": "Yessir!"}
{"prompt": "We can't take them.  Are you all right?", "completion": "We're leaving them?"}
{"prompt": "Really?  Which precious homily was it?", "completion": "\"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains...\""}
{"prompt": "I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.", "completion": "Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all."}
{"prompt": "I'd throw everything away for you.", "completion": "You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?"}
{"prompt": "Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.", "completion": "Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!"}
{"prompt": "That's a lie!", "completion": "Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you."}
{"prompt": "But not more than your comfort.", "completion": "And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?"}
{"prompt": "Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.", "completion": "George, you know I only love you, but..."}
{"prompt": "Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.", "completion": "You know very well who it is that I love."}
{"prompt": "Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.", "completion": "Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?"}
{"prompt": "Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.", "completion": "Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?"}
{"prompt": "That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!", "completion": "We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild."}
{"prompt": "George, I'm sorry.", "completion": "Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you."}
{"prompt": "Voltaire, of course...", "completion": "So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated."}
{"prompt": "Remember, George, \"It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong.\"", "completion": "That's good... who?"}
{"prompt": "I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?", "completion": "And dost thou live to ask it?"}
{"prompt": "Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!", "completion": "I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee."}
{"prompt": "Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.", "completion": "They can use their imaginations."}
{"prompt": "Let's get you darker!", "completion": "You're out of your mind!"}
{"prompt": "I think I will disappoint you.", "completion": "What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.", "completion": "I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings."}
{"prompt": "Well, we must be who we must be...", "completion": "And to think I am teaching you to become one of them..."}
{"prompt": "It's the freest land on earth.", "completion": "Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom."}
{"prompt": "I think America suits you.", "completion": "Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped."}
{"prompt": "I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.", "completion": "The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it."}
{"prompt": "Then why are you teaching me...?", "completion": "Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid."}
{"prompt": "What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?", "completion": "It's stupid, of course."}
{"prompt": "Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?", "completion": "That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements..."}
{"prompt": "Or, 'civilized'.", "completion": "In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes..."}
{"prompt": "Sally, our slave system is a British law...", "completion": "The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'."}
{"prompt": "Slavers capture them and bring them here.", "completion": "Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious."}
{"prompt": "Africa, of course.", "completion": "Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?"}
{"prompt": "God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!", "completion": "Where... do those men come from, George?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.", "completion": "Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?"}

{"prompt": "You know how to write one of these?", "completion": "There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good."}
{"prompt": "Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?", "completion": "Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores."}

{"prompt": "So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?", "completion": "Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than \"Lovejoy\"."}
{"prompt": "I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?", "completion": "Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy."}
{"prompt": "I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.", "completion": "Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie \"Fingers\"."}
{"prompt": "No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?", "completion": "I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that."}

{"prompt": "You can talk to me.", "completion": "That's what I thought. So let me put it this way..."}
{"prompt": "Harry, let me answer that.", "completion": "But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?"}
{"prompt": "That's the magic number.", "completion": "What's this movie you're doing first?"}
{"prompt": "It's not the kind of thing you do.", "completion": "C-18."}

{"prompt": "Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.", "completion": "The airport."}
{"prompt": "Leo, I don't know.", "completion": "Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?"}
{"prompt": "We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.", "completion": "He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?"}
{"prompt": "How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.", "completion": "You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?"}
{"prompt": "You serious?", "completion": "All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.", "completion": "Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest."}
{"prompt": "Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.", "completion": "Chili Palmer showed you my script?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.", "completion": "Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?"}
{"prompt": "You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?", "completion": "I'm working on a few things."}
{"prompt": "It's a different kind of deal.", "completion": "Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people \ufffd-"}
{"prompt": "I can't do it.", "completion": "You positive about that?"}
{"prompt": "What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.", "completion": "Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of \"Freaks\" and put 'em in this other one, \"Mr. Loverboy\"."}
{"prompt": "You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.", "completion": "I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.", "completion": "By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco."}
{"prompt": "What I been wondering is where's he been.", "completion": "Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately."}
{"prompt": "That's correct. Look at me.", "completion": "I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?"}
{"prompt": "Look at me, Ray.", "completion": "You say look at you?"}
{"prompt": "Ray. Look at me.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Or else use your fucking imagination.", "completion": "Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.", "completion": "Or else what?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.", "completion": "So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?"}
{"prompt": "Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.", "completion": "Never heard of him."}
{"prompt": "I work for Harry Zimm, alright?", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.", "completion": "Okay. So who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Hello? You there?", "completion": "Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real."}
{"prompt": "What three hundred grand?", "completion": "The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession."}
{"prompt": "Depends. Who's this?", "completion": "Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Who is this?", "completion": "Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?"}
{"prompt": "Whatever you want, Ray.", "completion": "Ray Barboni?"}
{"prompt": "I like it here.", "completion": "Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -\ufffd I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -\ufffd forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?"}
{"prompt": "Sovereign.", "completion": "You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?"}
{"prompt": "I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.", "completion": "Yeah? Which terminal?"}
{"prompt": "Why would I do that?", "completion": "'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me."}
{"prompt": "So what brings you to L.A., Bones?", "completion": "Don't insult me. Get up and turn around."}
{"prompt": "How'd you get in here?", "completion": "I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me."}
{"prompt": "You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.", "completion": "Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time."}
{"prompt": "Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.", "completion": "Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city."}
{"prompt": "Get in line, bro.", "completion": "I don't like waiting."}
{"prompt": "The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.", "completion": "He owes me money."}
{"prompt": "Ray Barboni. From Miami.", "completion": "What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?"}
{"prompt": "Get him out've here.", "completion": "Who the fuck are you?"}
{"prompt": "That's the idea. I'll think about it.", "completion": "That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time."}
{"prompt": "Something shouldn't be there.", "completion": "Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it."}
{"prompt": "By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?", "completion": "It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?"}
{"prompt": "Your wife a Lakers fan?", "completion": "I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here."}
{"prompt": "You have a card in here?", "completion": "Not yet. I just started."}
{"prompt": "You're an investor, is that it?", "completion": "I'm a producer."}
{"prompt": "What're you doing in Los Angeles?", "completion": "I'm in the movie business."}
{"prompt": "You live in Miami?", "completion": "That's right."}
{"prompt": "Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.", "completion": "Movie producer? Yeah, why not."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.", "completion": "What've you got?"}
{"prompt": "Leo spanked a waitress?", "completion": "Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now."}
{"prompt": "Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.", "completion": "Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room."}
{"prompt": "Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...", "completion": "Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie."}
{"prompt": "Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.", "completion": "Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names..."}
{"prompt": "Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Forget about Leo's money, Harry.", "completion": "You have it?"}
{"prompt": "So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.", "completion": "I found him."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.", "completion": "A meeting with who? You and Karen?"}
{"prompt": "I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.", "completion": "Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up."}
{"prompt": "Get the fuck outta my chair.", "completion": "Is he giving you a check or cash?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!", "completion": "Here's your keys, Harry."}
{"prompt": "How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?", "completion": "Hey, Harry."}
{"prompt": "That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.", "completion": "His shrink's trainer."}
{"prompt": "You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.", "completion": "I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing."}
{"prompt": "I had to tell 'em something.", "completion": "Never say anything unless you have to."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut."}
{"prompt": "You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'", "completion": "You're kidding, right?"}
{"prompt": "They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.", "completion": "That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am."}
{"prompt": "Read it. It's a grabber.", "completion": "No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down."}
{"prompt": "Let's see how we get along.", "completion": "Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?"}
{"prompt": "Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.", "completion": "What do you get out of this?"}
{"prompt": "But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.", "completion": "You don't even know these guys."}
{"prompt": "I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.", "completion": "Just a thought."}
{"prompt": "So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.", "completion": "That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.", "completion": "Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script."}
{"prompt": "The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.", "completion": "He drown?"}
{"prompt": "Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.", "completion": "So what's the problem?"}
{"prompt": "She looks familiar.", "completion": "She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades."}
{"prompt": "No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.", "completion": "\"Ride the Clouds\". Good picture."}
{"prompt": "Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in \"The Cyclone\".", "completion": "One of his best parts."}
{"prompt": "Who's the star?", "completion": "Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir."}
{"prompt": "It's not bad when you know what it's about.", "completion": "Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it."}
{"prompt": "\"Mr. Lovejoy\".", "completion": "\"Mr. Lovejoy\"? That's the title?"}
{"prompt": "A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my \"Driving Miss Daisy\".", "completion": "What's it called?"}
{"prompt": "Because I need half a million to buy a script.", "completion": "For a movie?"}
{"prompt": "Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.", "completion": "You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?"}
{"prompt": "Harry, look at me.", "completion": "You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?", "completion": "These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -\ufffd this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer \ufffd-"}
{"prompt": "Really? You ever been arrested?", "completion": "I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean."}
{"prompt": "Ever shot anybody.", "completion": "Once."}
{"prompt": "What does that mean?", "completion": "Maybe a few times I have."}
{"prompt": "You pack a gun?", "completion": "Not really."}
{"prompt": "I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.", "completion": "They always paid."}
{"prompt": "Is that right, that's what you do for a living?", "completion": "What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next."}
{"prompt": "I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.", "completion": "So you don't work for the casino?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not the guy, Harry.", "completion": "But you work for the casino?"}
{"prompt": "You mean, Leo?", "completion": "You wouldn't be talking to me if you were."}
{"prompt": "Part of it, yeah.", "completion": "Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?"}
{"prompt": "The shylock's the good guy.", "completion": "The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast."}
{"prompt": "I said I had an idea, that's all.", "completion": "That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy."}
{"prompt": "I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.", "completion": "That's it? That's your movie?"}
{"prompt": "Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...", "completion": "So he comes to L.A..."}
{"prompt": "That's right. As a matter of fact...", "completion": "Keep going."}
{"prompt": "Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.", "completion": "Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone."}
{"prompt": "I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.", "completion": "It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken."}
{"prompt": "You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.", "completion": "You just did."}
{"prompt": "Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.", "completion": "Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?"}
{"prompt": "You make movies, huh?", "completion": "I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Harry -\ufffd Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.", "completion": "Fuckin' basketball game."}
{"prompt": "I want you to.", "completion": "You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?"}
{"prompt": "You're not looking at me, Harry.", "completion": "Why do I have to keep looking at you?"}
{"prompt": "I know what a marker is.", "completion": "They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore..."}
{"prompt": "Harry, lemme give you some advice.", "completion": "A marker's like a check, Harry."}
{"prompt": "We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.", "completion": "Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?"}
{"prompt": "You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?", "completion": "Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?"}
{"prompt": "I want you to keep looking right here, okay?", "completion": "That's what I'm doing."}
{"prompt": "You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.", "completion": "I'm looking at you."}
{"prompt": "We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.", "completion": "Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?"}
{"prompt": "Where you been, Harry?", "completion": "Have we met? I don't recall."}
{"prompt": "Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.", "completion": "Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do."}
{"prompt": "You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...", "completion": "Twenty seven hundred."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.", "completion": "Ask your man here."}
{"prompt": "Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.", "completion": "'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.", "completion": "Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway."}
{"prompt": "What Get Away jet?", "completion": "It was in the Herald."}
{"prompt": "Personally?", "completion": "Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month."}
{"prompt": "How'd you know he died, he tell you?", "completion": "Yeah, he told me."}
{"prompt": "You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.", "completion": "He died."}
{"prompt": "You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?", "completion": "Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya."}
{"prompt": "Whatta you think, Chill?", "completion": "That's not bad. I think you got it down."}
{"prompt": "Compass.", "completion": "Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Buddy?", "completion": "Very nice..."}
{"prompt": "You're not going to tell me the rest?", "completion": "Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I'm listening.", "completion": "At that point, basically, that has to be it."}
{"prompt": "So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?", "completion": "It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation."}
{"prompt": "The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.", "completion": "Good-looking, too.  Like Karen."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.", "completion": "How do I know that?"}
{"prompt": "I believe it.", "completion": "I turn it on when I confront the guy."}
{"prompt": "That's not bad.", "completion": "That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Now you're squinting like you need glasses.", "completion": "How about this?"}
{"prompt": "What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?", "completion": "Wait. How about this?"}
{"prompt": "No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.", "completion": "Like this?"}
{"prompt": "Martin, look at me.", "completion": "I'm looking at you."}
{"prompt": "Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.", "completion": "Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?"}
{"prompt": "Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.", "completion": "What happened? The pressure got to you?"}
{"prompt": "One we're producing.", "completion": "With what? Wiseguy money?"}
{"prompt": "I'm thinking of a movie.", "completion": "One of mine?"}
{"prompt": "So you want to know.", "completion": "If you'd like to tell me, yeah."}
{"prompt": "So you don't know what I'm thinking.", "completion": "No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious."}
{"prompt": "You mean like we don't give a shit.", "completion": "Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads."}
{"prompt": "We talk different?", "completion": "It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views."}
{"prompt": "Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.", "completion": "A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech."}
{"prompt": "You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.", "completion": "Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play."}
{"prompt": "I'll find you, Leo...", "completion": "Yeah. That was a good party."}
{"prompt": "At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.", "completion": "But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be."}
{"prompt": "Sit down, Leo.", "completion": "You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?"}
{"prompt": "You can keep what you won today. That's yours.", "completion": "It's all mine."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.", "completion": "How? By taking my money?"}
{"prompt": "Here's another tip...", "completion": "It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?"}
{"prompt": "Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.", "completion": "How'd you know I was here?"}
{"prompt": "From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?", "completion": "Who told you that?"}
{"prompt": "You've been losing.", "completion": "I'm up twelve grand today."}
{"prompt": "They report it to the IRS.", "completion": "You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?", "completion": "You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?"}
{"prompt": "I know who he works for. Where's your phone.", "completion": "I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are."}
{"prompt": "Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?", "completion": "Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you don't see my sign?", "completion": "We call you a taxi."}
{"prompt": "It's not one of these?", "completion": "You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine."}
{"prompt": "What took you so long?", "completion": "Couldn't find my toothbrush."}
{"prompt": "I'll be right back.", "completion": "Go get your stuff."}
{"prompt": "You don't act like it?", "completion": "I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?"}
{"prompt": "Were you scared up there?", "completion": "You bet."}
{"prompt": "Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!", "completion": "Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry..."}
{"prompt": "You okay?", "completion": "Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake."}
{"prompt": "You're as bad as Harry...", "completion": "I'll go. I'll go."}
{"prompt": "Are you going down?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.", "completion": "It's not Dave. It's a movie."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.", "completion": "You sure?"}
{"prompt": "Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.", "completion": "Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital."}
{"prompt": "Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, Chili? Look at me.", "completion": "Harry... My God..."}
{"prompt": "Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.", "completion": "I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?"}
{"prompt": "You thought I was faking?", "completion": "No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general."}
{"prompt": "Really.", "completion": "I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "Yeah. There's a girl in it now."}
{"prompt": "How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.", "completion": "That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it."}
{"prompt": "So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?", "completion": "How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.", "completion": "For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.", "completion": "You don't like Martin much, do you?"}
{"prompt": "How'd you meet Martin anyway?", "completion": "Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?"}
{"prompt": "Depends, who pays?", "completion": "Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number."}
{"prompt": "The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.", "completion": "That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.", "completion": "A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid."}
{"prompt": "You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.", "completion": "Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.", "completion": "This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset..."}
{"prompt": "I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.", "completion": "And you think the movie business is any different?"}
{"prompt": "Why does anyone want to be in movies?", "completion": "Yesterday, you were a loan shark."}
{"prompt": "That why you came over here, to ask me that?", "completion": "I want to know."}
{"prompt": "Sounds fair.", "completion": "What do you get out of it?"}
{"prompt": "There a part in it for you?", "completion": "I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin."}
{"prompt": "Not yet.", "completion": "You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him."}
{"prompt": "I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.", "completion": "Then you've read it?"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think it's not horrible."}
{"prompt": "I got you a copy of the script.", "completion": "I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house."}
{"prompt": "You been here the whole time?", "completion": "I just caught the end."}
{"prompt": "Right. See how your story ends.", "completion": "Yeah. Right.  Listen, \"Touch of Evil\"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?"}
{"prompt": "Don't go out of your way.", "completion": "Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.", "completion": "Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you."}
{"prompt": "Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.", "completion": "Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped."}
{"prompt": "He must mean after \"Slime Creature 3\".", "completion": "That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?"}
{"prompt": "I married Martin. That was a full- time job.", "completion": "You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'", "completion": "How come you stopped making movies with Harry?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, \"Cabin in the...\"", "completion": "\"Cotton\"."}
{"prompt": "I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.", "completion": "Man, can you scream."}
{"prompt": "Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.", "completion": "For any movie."}
{"prompt": "You saw that one?", "completion": "Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in \"Mildred Pierce\" -\ufffd which by the way was a better book than a movie -\ufffd did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look."}
{"prompt": "...That's what we finally decided.", "completion": "Like in \"Bride of the Mutant\", when you played the whole end with that torn top."}
{"prompt": "I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons \ufffd-", "completion": "Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.", "completion": "Rough day on the set?"}
{"prompt": "Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?", "completion": "No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here."}
{"prompt": "What're you doing here?", "completion": "I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night."}
{"prompt": "How much is the wife offered?", "completion": "Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?"}
{"prompt": "A real bargain.", "completion": "A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years."}
{"prompt": "But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.", "completion": "A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad."}
{"prompt": "The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?", "completion": "That's right. Three percent."}
{"prompt": "Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.", "completion": "I know what a vig is."}
{"prompt": "No, it was open. It wasn't locked.", "completion": "What if it was?"}
{"prompt": "The door from the patio, in back.", "completion": "You broke in?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.", "completion": "Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit."}
{"prompt": "I'm thinking about producing.", "completion": "How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies."}
{"prompt": "I'm going into the movie business.", "completion": "What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.", "completion": "Whatta you doing out there?"}
{"prompt": "How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?", "completion": "He already knew it."}
{"prompt": "You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.", "completion": "All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't."}
{"prompt": "You said don't say nothing and I didn't.", "completion": "No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead."}
{"prompt": "Don't say a fuckin' word.", "completion": "I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time."}
{"prompt": "In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.", "completion": "I told you not to -\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.", "completion": "That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.", "completion": "Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that."}
{"prompt": "That's what the guy said.", "completion": "Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat."}
{"prompt": "What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.", "completion": "You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?"}
{"prompt": "What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.", "completion": "Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films."}
{"prompt": "They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?", "completion": "Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's."}
{"prompt": "That's great, Harry. So what's the --", "completion": "What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them."}
{"prompt": "You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.", "completion": "So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'"}
{"prompt": "Pick 'n' Save.", "completion": "Hm?"}
{"prompt": "She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.", "completion": "Yeah? What three words, Harry?"}
{"prompt": "All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.", "completion": "What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick."}
{"prompt": "Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.", "completion": "Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?"}
{"prompt": "How honorable of you.", "completion": "Yeah, but whose point of view?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, what'd he have to say?", "completion": "He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday."}
{"prompt": "So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?", "completion": "No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script."}
{"prompt": "I mean morally. Murray was my friend.", "completion": "Murray's dead."}
{"prompt": "I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.", "completion": "You seem to feel fine about it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.", "completion": "What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?", "completion": "I miss Murray, Harry."}
{"prompt": "Come on in.", "completion": "What a spectacular view."}
{"prompt": "Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.", "completion": "Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?"}
{"prompt": "Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.", "completion": "Hello, Doris."}
{"prompt": "Chili and me.", "completion": "Harry -\ufffd"}
{"prompt": "Harry, we spoke with Martin.", "completion": "'We?'"}
{"prompt": "Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?", "completion": "He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want."}
{"prompt": "What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.", "completion": "Oh, yeah, sure."}
{"prompt": "Well. I got an audition tomorrow.", "completion": "No problem. You go on off to bed."}

{"prompt": "That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.", "completion": "That's where you got the idea?"}
{"prompt": "He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.", "completion": "Maybe you didn't hear me."}

{"prompt": "You don't? What happened to Muff?", "completion": "Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.", "completion": "I don't have a dog."}
{"prompt": "I don't hear anything.", "completion": "When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room."}

{"prompt": "The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.", "completion": "Shylock?"}
{"prompt": "I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?", "completion": "What money?"}
{"prompt": "Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.", "completion": "Mob guy?"}
{"prompt": "And after all, you have such morals.", "completion": "Which two?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with."}

{"prompt": "Yeah, Karen knows him.", "completion": "But you are interested?"}

{"prompt": "Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?", "completion": "You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat."}

We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.", "completion": "I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do."}

{"prompt": "Morning, skipper.", "completion": "One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire."}
{"prompt": "Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.", "completion": "Damn mind of it's own."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?", "completion": "Fucker!"}
{"prompt": "Lemme see.", "completion": "Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge."}
{"prompt": "What? You sure?", "completion": "That's what it says."}
{"prompt": "How about now?", "completion": "Sixty pounds."}
{"prompt": "You think the extra strain caused it?", "completion": "Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things."}
{"prompt": "They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.", "completion": "I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size."}
{"prompt": "With that coxswain dickhead.", "completion": "Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?"}
{"prompt": "I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.", "completion": "Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah.", "completion": "Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Get up."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Dodge.  Dodge."}
{"prompt": "Hell no. You think I'm crazy?", "completion": "What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?"}
{"prompt": "Right. Wednesday.", "completion": "Did you?"}
{"prompt": "Then what the hell happened to him?", "completion": "Try Wednesday."}
{"prompt": "I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.", "completion": "Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside."}
{"prompt": "A what?", "completion": "I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah.", "completion": "I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma."}
{"prompt": "Seen a lota movies.", "completion": "Smokes?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe he isn't alone.", "completion": "Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?"}
{"prompt": "I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.", "completion": "One guy isn't gonna be so stupid."}
{"prompt": "Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?", "completion": "So we kill him?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe that is his boat.", "completion": "Gimme a break."}
{"prompt": "Light in those passages ain't so good.", "completion": "I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody."}

{"prompt": "I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.", "completion": "Guess I'll just keep working."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!", "completion": "What other choices have we got?"}
{"prompt": "Or uninvited guests.", "completion": "This's gonna hurt a little."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.", "completion": "Last thing we want is extra partners."}
{"prompt": "Ever heard of insurance, big boy?", "completion": "If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot."}
{"prompt": "Bring it on, dude.", "completion": "Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either."}
{"prompt": "Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?", "completion": "Ready?"}
{"prompt": "Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?", "completion": "Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow."}
{"prompt": "Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?", "completion": "Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You think that's funny"}
{"prompt": "Roger.", "completion": "Roger?"}
{"prompt": "Maureen.", "completion": "Maureen?"}
{"prompt": "Maureen.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it."}
{"prompt": "Why not.", "completion": "What is your first name?"}
{"prompt": "Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.", "completion": "One more?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Where from?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "Don't fall asleep."}
{"prompt": "There's a charming thought.", "completion": "You're late."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait."}
{"prompt": "Then you're a lucky man.", "completion": "We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first."}
{"prompt": "If money can buy what he wants.", "completion": "I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy."}
{"prompt": "Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!", "completion": "That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants."}
{"prompt": "You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!", "completion": "What the hell happened!"}
{"prompt": "Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?", "completion": "Conveniently enough for you."}
{"prompt": "You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.", "completion": "I didn't touch the fucking radio."}
{"prompt": "Don't lie to me!", "completion": "What the fuck -- ?"}
{"prompt": "You smashed it!", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.", "completion": "Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!"}
{"prompt": "Maybe you can tell me then.", "completion": "The radio!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know what you're talking about?", "completion": "I think you know."}
{"prompt": "With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.", "completion": "Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!"}
{"prompt": "For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.", "completion": "There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.", "completion": "What do you propose?"}
{"prompt": "Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.", "completion": "I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth."}
{"prompt": "So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?", "completion": "How do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "On a passenger ship in 1953?", "completion": "If they knew what they were carrying."}
{"prompt": "It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?", "completion": "Not me."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "I think you better see this for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Murphy.", "completion": "You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on \"C\" deck. Cabin 400."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Dodge to Murphy."}
{"prompt": "I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.", "completion": "Do what you need to do. Just do it fast."}
{"prompt": "So whoever did this might still be around.", "completion": "Can't you use something else?"}
{"prompt": "Could be meant as a warning.", "completion": "That'd be my guess."}
{"prompt": "Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.", "completion": "Damn barbaric is what it is."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.", "completion": "Bodies're too fresh."}
{"prompt": "We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.", "completion": "If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options."}
{"prompt": "Why not? Why the fuck not?", "completion": "What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?"}
{"prompt": "I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?", "completion": "And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?"}
{"prompt": "Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.", "completion": "Not in the eyes of the law."}
{"prompt": "Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.", "completion": "If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah.", "completion": "Sounds like the hull."}
{"prompt": "How about you Epps?", "completion": "Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running."}
{"prompt": "The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.", "completion": "I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget."}
{"prompt": "So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.", "completion": "Yeah, yeah. I'm on it."}
{"prompt": "It looks like it.", "completion": "You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?"}
{"prompt": "A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.", "completion": "Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich."}
{"prompt": "Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.", "completion": "So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?"}
{"prompt": "Then it happened before they scuttled her.", "completion": "Or somebody stopped them."}
{"prompt": "A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?", "completion": "Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat."}
{"prompt": "It's a hell of a lot of money.", "completion": "What, you think there's something funny about it?"}
{"prompt": "Went aboard.", "completion": "She take a radio?"}
{"prompt": "Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.", "completion": "Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway."}
{"prompt": "Goddamit, Dodge.", "completion": "What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper."}
{"prompt": "How long?", "completion": "Three, four days."}
{"prompt": "How long, then?", "completion": "I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- ."}
{"prompt": "What about running number two by itself?", "completion": "It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it."}
{"prompt": "We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.", "completion": "I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is."}
{"prompt": "But how long?", "completion": "Hard to say."}
{"prompt": "I know I know, two ways to do anything --", "completion": "The right way and the wrong way."}
{"prompt": "How much longer's that gonna take?", "completion": "Like I always say --"}
{"prompt": "I thought you said it was just a blade.", "completion": "Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "Turbine rotor's shot."}
{"prompt": "How long to fix?", "completion": "Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending."}
{"prompt": "Threw a turbine blade.", "completion": "The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered."}
{"prompt": "Mother fucker!", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.", "completion": "Sounds reasonable."}
{"prompt": "It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.", "completion": "The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull."}
{"prompt": "If you get it back in one piece.", "completion": "It's a risk I'm willing to take."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.", "completion": "You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million."}
{"prompt": "What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.", "completion": "Smugglers maybe."}
{"prompt": "You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?", "completion": "Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.", "completion": "I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Nothing. Let's get outa here."}
{"prompt": "You okay?", "completion": "Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all."}
{"prompt": "I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.", "completion": "Better than starving to death."}
{"prompt": "Sudden flashes of light.", "completion": "I feel fine."}
{"prompt": "Headache, nausea, lights?", "completion": "Lights?"}
{"prompt": "Any dizziness?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Stay away. Or else.", "completion": "Because of the gold."}
{"prompt": "Coffee.", "completion": "You're a pal."}
{"prompt": "What'd he look like?", "completion": "Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there."}
{"prompt": "That's a good thing?", "completion": "Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better."}
{"prompt": "That's what I call a payday.", "completion": "Hell yeah."}
{"prompt": "Probably didn't have time.", "completion": "Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold."}
{"prompt": "Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.", "completion": "Then why didn't they take it."}
{"prompt": "He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.", "completion": "You mean, before she sank."}
{"prompt": "Too big. More like a freighter.", "completion": "Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass."}
{"prompt": "I bet you did.", "completion": "Could be a fishing boat."}
{"prompt": "Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?", "completion": "Showed him a hell of a lot more than that."}
{"prompt": "Maybe twenty gallons an hour.", "completion": "Morning everybody."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.", "completion": "What's slow?"}
{"prompt": "I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.", "completion": "I don't give a damn about the gold."}
{"prompt": "I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.", "completion": "It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out."}
{"prompt": "I think I see it pretty well.", "completion": "It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way."}
{"prompt": "I didn't want it to turn out this way.", "completion": "Murphy, don't you see what's happening?"}
{"prompt": "The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.", "completion": "And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?"}
{"prompt": "It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.", "completion": "So you killed them?"}
{"prompt": "Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.", "completion": "You killed them."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "We hit land."}
{"prompt": "If the weather holds it might not be so bad.", "completion": "It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat."}
{"prompt": "Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.", "completion": "Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water."}
{"prompt": "Maybe it was more than that.", "completion": "They went crazy."}
{"prompt": "Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. \"Like wild dogs.\"", "completion": "Over the gold."}
{"prompt": "Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Right here.", "completion": "What do we do with him?"}
{"prompt": "He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.", "completion": "Epps? You there?"}
{"prompt": "Either of you seen Dodge?", "completion": "Nope."}
{"prompt": "Murphy to Epps.", "completion": "Epps, over."}
{"prompt": "Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?", "completion": "Just lucky I guess."}
{"prompt": "What's that supposed to mean?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.", "completion": "She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave."}
{"prompt": "Something bad happened here, Murphy.", "completion": "That much I think we've already established."}
{"prompt": "No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.", "completion": "Victims of what?"}
{"prompt": "What happened.", "completion": "Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks."}
{"prompt": "Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.", "completion": "Showing you what?"}
{"prompt": "What, like some kind of ghost?", "completion": "I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone."}
{"prompt": "Not our mystery guest again.", "completion": "No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, are we?", "completion": "When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone."}
{"prompt": "Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.", "completion": "Are we smart enough to avoid that?"}
{"prompt": "I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?", "completion": "The what?"}
{"prompt": "Wish I could say the same.", "completion": "What do you think happened on this boat?"}
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "Couldn't sleep."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't matter.", "completion": "Hey."}
{"prompt": "Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.", "completion": "It's not gonna hold us."}
{"prompt": "If it was a ship she hit.", "completion": "It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too."}
{"prompt": "But where's the damage?", "completion": "Maybe the other ship took the worst of it."}
{"prompt": "Collision? With what?", "completion": "The page's missing. Then their SOS was real."}
{"prompt": "Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.", "completion": "\"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made.\""}
{"prompt": "February first.", "completion": "The same day she supposedly went down."}
{"prompt": "But, who -- ?", "completion": "\"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill.\""}
{"prompt": "Somebody took it out of commission last night.", "completion": "Smashed it up pretty bad."}
{"prompt": "The ah... the radio's out.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.", "completion": "Only something must've gone wrong."}
{"prompt": "Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.", "completion": "You're saying they mutinied for the gold?"}
{"prompt": "No. I'll try again later.", "completion": "They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS."}
{"prompt": "How's he doing?", "completion": "Same. Any luck?"}
{"prompt": "He needs a doctor.", "completion": "I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him."}
{"prompt": "Greer?", "completion": "I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.", "completion": "Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio."}
{"prompt": "Epps.", "completion": "You just shoot at something?"}
{"prompt": "Yup.", "completion": "Murphy to Epps."}
{"prompt": "No cowboy shit. Right.", "completion": "Got your light?"}
{"prompt": "Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?", "completion": "No cowboy shit up there, understand?"}
{"prompt": "We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.", "completion": "Guess that'd be me. Again."}
{"prompt": "It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.", "completion": "So, we find this guy and make a deal with him."}
{"prompt": "Of course I'm sure. I saw him.", "completion": "You sure it wasn't me?"}
{"prompt": "I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.", "completion": "Are you sure?"}
{"prompt": "There's somebody else on this boat.", "completion": "What? What the hell're you talking about."}
{"prompt": "The guy. He just came this way.", "completion": "What guy?"}
{"prompt": "Did you see him?", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.", "completion": "Take it easy, you'll live longer."}
{"prompt": "Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.", "completion": "Why not call for help?"}
{"prompt": "Only way to be.", "completion": "Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured."}
{"prompt": "I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.", "completion": "You're more practical than superstitious."}
{"prompt": "Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.", "completion": "You think she's sailing without a crew?"}
{"prompt": "She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.", "completion": "So what did happen?"}
{"prompt": "Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?", "completion": "Nope."}
{"prompt": "Her destination was Halifax, yeah.", "completion": "Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her."}
{"prompt": "Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.", "completion": "She was sailing up north, right?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Thanks.", "completion": "What'd you find up there?"}
{"prompt": "They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.", "completion": "Coffee?"}
{"prompt": "Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.", "completion": "The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try."}
{"prompt": "It's my pen name.", "completion": "Go on."}
{"prompt": "Fine with me.", "completion": "Candy?"}
{"prompt": "All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.", "completion": "Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that."}
{"prompt": "Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.", "completion": "You think whoever did this is reasonable?"}
{"prompt": "What about the gold?", "completion": "Leave it."}
{"prompt": "So whoever did this now has our shotgun.", "completion": "Doesn't look like it much matters."}
{"prompt": "Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.", "completion": "Can't find the shotgun."}
{"prompt": "The mooring hasn't come taught.", "completion": "He took the shotgun and a light."}
{"prompt": "Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.", "completion": "We're still drifting."}
{"prompt": "It's a Noaa buoy.", "completion": "A what?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up.", "completion": "Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?"}
{"prompt": "The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.", "completion": "Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say."}
{"prompt": "Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!", "completion": "We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.", "completion": "We're not gonna be able to pump it!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, man.", "completion": "We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?"}
{"prompt": "Say what?", "completion": "Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins."}
{"prompt": "Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.", "completion": "You've been out for about a day."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "You don't remember?"}
{"prompt": "How're you feeling?", "completion": "Lost my sea legs."}
{"prompt": "Never been more thirsty in my life.", "completion": "Drink up then."}
{"prompt": "Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.", "completion": "Maybe."}
{"prompt": "Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.", "completion": "And look what happened."}
{"prompt": "Ho-ly shit.", "completion": "Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago."}
{"prompt": "Pretty low all around.", "completion": "We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around."}
{"prompt": "I say we off-load some of that gold now.", "completion": "Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here."}
{"prompt": "Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.", "completion": "Supposing he wants to get bad with us?"}
{"prompt": "Moving to Sweden.", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.", "completion": "Greer?"}
{"prompt": "And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?", "completion": "Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?"}
{"prompt": "What now?", "completion": "We could call for help."}
{"prompt": "I heard that.", "completion": "Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.", "completion": "It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage."}
{"prompt": "So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?", "completion": "We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan."}
{"prompt": "If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.", "completion": "Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for."}
{"prompt": "Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.", "completion": "Ho, baby!"}
{"prompt": "Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?", "completion": "How much you figure that's worth, skipper?"}
{"prompt": "Morning.", "completion": "You're up late."}
{"prompt": "Some classy tub in it's day, huh?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.", "completion": "So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before."}
{"prompt": "You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.", "completion": "We've done it before."}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her."}
{"prompt": "Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.", "completion": "Murphy, goddamit."}
{"prompt": "It's funny.", "completion": "How's that?"}
{"prompt": "Call the Coastguard?", "completion": "Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out."}
{"prompt": "Too deep to anchor out there.", "completion": "Looks like it's adrift."}
{"prompt": "I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.", "completion": "Alright. I'll be right up."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west."}
{"prompt": "Red sky at night, sailor's delight.", "completion": "Red sky in morning, sailor take warning."}
{"prompt": "You got that right.", "completion": "Better than \"making hamburger for Mickey D.\""}
{"prompt": "He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.", "completion": "I must be in the wrong business."}
{"prompt": "What do you say, Dodge?", "completion": "Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia."}
{"prompt": "Of course they did.", "completion": "Let the buyer beware."}
{"prompt": "Go.", "completion": "The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka."}
{"prompt": "Or what?", "completion": "Greer to Murphy."}
{"prompt": "These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.", "completion": "You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan."}
{"prompt": "Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?", "completion": "I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go."}
{"prompt": "Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.", "completion": "As I said, what seems to be the trouble?"}
{"prompt": "You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.", "completion": "What seems to be the trouble, ladies?"}
{"prompt": "Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.", "completion": "You're kidding, right?"}
{"prompt": "That cost me twenty grand at least.", "completion": "Fifteen, at the most."}
{"prompt": "No, no. You got leak.", "completion": "You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "You got a leak in the number nine compartment."}
{"prompt": "I thought you say Tuesday.", "completion": "Better late than never."}
{"prompt": "But I can't --", "completion": "JUST DO IT!"}
{"prompt": "I just buzzed him in.", "completion": "What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!"}
{"prompt": "Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.", "completion": "What do you mean \"on his way up\"!?"}
{"prompt": "She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.", "completion": "I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I heard about that.", "completion": "I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days."}
{"prompt": "Are you going to yell at me?", "completion": "About what?"}
{"prompt": "Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.", "completion": "Pumpkin, are you in there?"}
{"prompt": "I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it..."}
{"prompt": "Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.", "completion": "Pumpkin? What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "I guess.", "completion": "Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them."}
{"prompt": "What is it now?", "completion": "Are you still looking for a job?"}
{"prompt": "I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.", "completion": "I have some good news for you, Pumpkin."}
{"prompt": "Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.", "completion": "I made spaghetti. Do you want some?"}
{"prompt": "Yup.", "completion": "God, how horrifying."}
{"prompt": "Maxine.", "completion": "Not the Maxine?"}
{"prompt": "Give up?", "completion": "YES."}
{"prompt": "Someone from the past.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Guess.", "completion": "How should I know?"}
{"prompt": "Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.", "completion": "Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying."}
{"prompt": "It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.", "completion": "Look, I told you I'm not going to college."}
{"prompt": "Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.", "completion": "Will you get off my back for once?"}
{"prompt": "Have you seen my blue spatula?", "completion": "Nope. What are you making, pancakes?"}
{"prompt": "Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...", "completion": "I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!"}
{"prompt": "I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...", "completion": "Please tell me it isn't that teenager!"}
{"prompt": "What are you trying to say?", "completion": "It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out."}
{"prompt": "Hey... so, what brings you down here?", "completion": "I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh..."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.", "completion": "We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!"}
{"prompt": "Hello...", "completion": "Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...", "completion": "Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid..."}
{"prompt": "Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.", "completion": "Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.", "completion": "I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!"}
{"prompt": "No, really I --", "completion": "Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie."}
{"prompt": "Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...", "completion": "Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet."}
{"prompt": "Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.", "completion": "Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!"}
{"prompt": "Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?", "completion": "Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?"}
{"prompt": "That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.", "completion": "Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?"}
{"prompt": "But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?", "completion": "I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --"}
{"prompt": "Help me what?", "completion": "Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!"}
{"prompt": "I didn't check my messages...", "completion": "Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you."}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --"}
{"prompt": "Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.", "completion": "Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened."}
{"prompt": "Well, yes...", "completion": "I..."}
{"prompt": "So what do you think?", "completion": "I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?"}
{"prompt": "As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...", "completion": "...wow..."}
{"prompt": "Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.", "completion": "Hmm."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?", "completion": "I'm not really sure - working, I guess..."}
{"prompt": "Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?", "completion": "Uh-oh."}
{"prompt": "And how does an image like this help us to see that?", "completion": "I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?"}
{"prompt": "And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?", "completion": "It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something..."}
{"prompt": "Did you actually do this painting?", "completion": "Well, no - it's more like a \"found art object.\""}
{"prompt": "These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.", "completion": "Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture..."}
{"prompt": "I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.", "completion": "I see... interesting..."}
{"prompt": "It's supposed to be Don Knotts.", "completion": "And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?"}
{"prompt": "Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.", "completion": "Who is this, Enid?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus...", "completion": "And what can you tell us about this..."}
{"prompt": "But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.", "completion": "It's not optional!"}
{"prompt": "What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!", "completion": "Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay... I won't say a word...", "completion": "What the hell is wrong with you?!"}
{"prompt": "But I was only trying to be friendly...", "completion": "Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job."}
{"prompt": "Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...", "completion": "Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater..."}
{"prompt": "You can count on me, sir!", "completion": "What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!"}
{"prompt": "Are you ready to go?", "completion": "I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds."}
{"prompt": "Hi Enid.", "completion": "Hey Josh."}
{"prompt": "Okay... I promise.", "completion": "Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it..."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Because if you do, I'll kill you!"}
{"prompt": "Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?", "completion": "I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this."}
{"prompt": "How long have you been up?", "completion": "I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, hi...", "completion": "Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious..."}
{"prompt": "You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...", "completion": "Why do you have that stupid poster?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well --", "completion": "It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!"}
{"prompt": "You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!", "completion": "That's just the way I am!"}
{"prompt": "When did I say I hated you?", "completion": "You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me."}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "Then why do you hate me so much?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right...", "completion": "\"Yeah, right\"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean \"why\"?", "completion": "Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?"}
{"prompt": "Do you want something to drink?", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Are you the one who left that note?", "completion": "I guess."}
{"prompt": "Hi... what's up?", "completion": "Can I come in?"}
{"prompt": "I just stopped in to say hi.", "completion": "Yeah, well... hi..."}
{"prompt": "Hi Josh.", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...", "completion": "You need counseling."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God, that's HIM!", "completion": "Forget it."}
{"prompt": "I figured something like that...", "completion": "Jesus, look at this guy."}
{"prompt": "That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.", "completion": "In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right.", "completion": "No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell."}
{"prompt": "So, where's \"Weird Al\"?", "completion": "SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down."}
{"prompt": "Aren't there a million places like this?", "completion": "This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners."}
{"prompt": "Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.", "completion": "It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you."}
{"prompt": "So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "That guy rules!", "completion": "Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do..."}
{"prompt": "So Josh...", "completion": "Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done."}
{"prompt": "Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.", "completion": "I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --"}
{"prompt": "Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.", "completion": "What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of \"frozen yogurt\"?"}
{"prompt": "It just came yesterday...", "completion": "Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder."}
{"prompt": "Maybe an orange juice.", "completion": "Wow... finally."}
{"prompt": "Actually, he's a really nice guy.", "completion": "Do you want anything?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!", "completion": "You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps."}
{"prompt": "Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "What time?", "completion": "I dunno..."}
{"prompt": "That's all you're bringing?", "completion": "I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime."}
{"prompt": "So where's all your stuff?", "completion": "There."}
{"prompt": "So, whaddya think?", "completion": "It's fine."}
{"prompt": "But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.", "completion": "I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off."}
{"prompt": "I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.", "completion": "Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan."}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.", "completion": "Please let me come with you. Please please please..."}
{"prompt": "I need to talk to you.", "completion": "I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you."}
{"prompt": "FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!", "completion": "Hello?"}
{"prompt": "You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!", "completion": "You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!"}
{"prompt": "There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!", "completion": "Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!", "completion": "Well, what am I supposed to say? \"I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere\"?!"}
{"prompt": "What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?", "completion": "I said \"great\"..."}
{"prompt": "Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...", "completion": "Great..."}
{"prompt": "When was this?", "completion": "I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes."}
{"prompt": "Why? What did he say?", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "What? When did you see Josh?!", "completion": "He came into work."}
{"prompt": "I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.", "completion": "Josh says this is a really good neighborhood..."}
{"prompt": "Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...", "completion": "It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!"}
{"prompt": "I don't believe you.", "completion": "Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? Who?", "completion": "Just some people from work..."}

{"prompt": "I can't believe it - he actually scored!", "completion": "How repulsive!"}
{"prompt": "Do you still want to do something tonight?", "completion": "What happened to Seymour?"}
{"prompt": "God, I'm so sick of Seymour.", "completion": "Hello?"}
{"prompt": "That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.", "completion": "Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went."}
{"prompt": "Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?", "completion": "What thing?"}
{"prompt": "You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.", "completion": "You're insane."}
{"prompt": "Don't you want nice stuff?", "completion": "I can't imagine spending money on towels."}
{"prompt": "I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?", "completion": "Why do you care about this kind of stuff?"}
{"prompt": "Look, we have to get these...", "completion": "I can't afford stuff like this right now."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...", "completion": "No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is."}
{"prompt": "I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...", "completion": "I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that..."}
{"prompt": "No, really...", "completion": "God, you're really obsessed..."}
{"prompt": "I think one of us should fuck Josh...", "completion": "Go ahead..."}
{"prompt": "Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?", "completion": "Yeah, I guess... call me..."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to do something tonight?", "completion": "I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake..."}
{"prompt": "If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.", "completion": "Yeah, thanks."}
{"prompt": "Now are you going to get a regular job?", "completion": "Don't worry."}
{"prompt": "What was that all about? I thought everything must go!", "completion": "Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus."}
{"prompt": "Fuck it. Everything must go!", "completion": "Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase..."}
{"prompt": "I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...", "completion": "This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff."}
{"prompt": "We were such desperate sluts back then.", "completion": "What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!"}
{"prompt": "That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...", "completion": "I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him."}
{"prompt": "Wasn't it like eighth grade?", "completion": "Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!"}
{"prompt": "I dunno, but next week is my last class...", "completion": "Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...", "completion": "When are you finally going to get your diploma?"}
{"prompt": "Get away from me!", "completion": "Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job..."}
{"prompt": "Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?", "completion": "...maybe we should be lesbos..."}
{"prompt": "Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!", "completion": "That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration."}
{"prompt": "You're just jealous.", "completion": "Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!"}
{"prompt": "He gives me a total boner!", "completion": "He's like the biggest idiot of all time!"}
{"prompt": "You're gross.  See that guy?", "completion": "Which one?"}
{"prompt": "You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.", "completion": "Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together."}
{"prompt": "...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.", "completion": "I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly."}
{"prompt": "Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.", "completion": "God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me."}
{"prompt": "I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.", "completion": "Like what?"}
{"prompt": "But those are our people...", "completion": "Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?"}
{"prompt": "That rules!", "completion": "No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos."}
{"prompt": "At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...", "completion": "He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!"}
{"prompt": "God, how can you stand all these assholes?", "completion": "I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody."}
{"prompt": "That guy is totally amazing.", "completion": "He does that every single day."}
{"prompt": "Just now... I went with Seymour.", "completion": "You cunt!"}
{"prompt": "Anthony's II!", "completion": "No way... when?"}
{"prompt": "You won't believe it! Guess!", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "Give me all your money, bitch!", "completion": "Where did you get that?"}
{"prompt": "I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.", "completion": "Wait..."}
{"prompt": "I totally, totally hate you.", "completion": "Aw c'mon, this is a fun party."}
{"prompt": "I don't believe you.", "completion": "If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?"}
{"prompt": "What? Where?!", "completion": "It's a surprise."}
{"prompt": "We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.", "completion": "I know a party we could go to..."}
{"prompt": "Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.", "completion": "Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick."}
{"prompt": "God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?", "completion": "How about this?"}
{"prompt": "Ew ... when did you get that?", "completion": "This morning at Seymour's garage sale."}
{"prompt": "How about this one?", "completion": "Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm."}
{"prompt": "I didn't get it either.", "completion": "Everybody's too stupid!"}
{"prompt": "What was that all about?", "completion": "It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!"}
{"prompt": "Why are we going here? I hate this place.", "completion": "It'll only take a second."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.", "completion": "Should we leave a note?"}
{"prompt": "JOSH!", "completion": "I'll bet he never jerks off..."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you ask him.", "completion": "JOSH!"}
{"prompt": "Waiting for the bus that never comes...", "completion": "I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --"}
{"prompt": "There he is...", "completion": "As always."}
{"prompt": "Let's go hassle Josh.", "completion": "\"Hassle\"?"}
{"prompt": "I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.", "completion": "Where are we going?"}
{"prompt": "We still have to go in there sometime.", "completion": "It's always closed..."}
{"prompt": "Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?", "completion": "Fuck you, bitch!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.", "completion": "What? How long have you been standing there?"}
{"prompt": "You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.", "completion": "Just promise you'll do it."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun."}
{"prompt": "What, is she black now?", "completion": "I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies..."}
{"prompt": "Somewhere downtown.", "completion": "\"Funky\"?"}
{"prompt": "Forget it, I can't explain it...", "completion": "We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but... you know what I mean.", "completion": "Not really..."}
{"prompt": "I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...", "completion": "That guy is many things but he definitely isn't \"cool\"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen..."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah...", "completion": "He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats..."}
{"prompt": "It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?", "completion": "What about the \"striking redhead in the yellow dress\"?"}
{"prompt": "I know... I still can't get over that his name was \"Seymour.\"", "completion": "He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive..."}
{"prompt": "Ew, it's like some gross rat...", "completion": "That was truly pathetic."}
{"prompt": "Gross!", "completion": "I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth."}
{"prompt": "Come on, it's too late now...", "completion": "Ew, look at this..."}
{"prompt": "Bingo!", "completion": "What should we do? What if he recognizes us?"}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.", "completion": "The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!"}
{"prompt": "This is way too creepy.", "completion": "He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance."}
{"prompt": "I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?", "completion": "This kind of thing must happen to him all the time."}
{"prompt": "We should follow him home.", "completion": "He doesn't even look that bummed out, really."}
{"prompt": "Totally! Look!", "completion": "He's insane!"}
{"prompt": "I dunno...", "completion": "Are you sure?"}
{"prompt": "He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!", "completion": "Do you think he knows?"}
{"prompt": "Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!", "completion": "What's he doing now?"}
{"prompt": "I can't believe it!", "completion": "What's going on now? What's he doing?"}
{"prompt": "What exactly is a cardigan anyway?", "completion": "It's obviously him!"}
{"prompt": "She says she wants to MMPH!", "completion": "Is he wearing a green cardigan?"}
{"prompt": "I'm going to tell him you said that.", "completion": "SHUT UP!"}
{"prompt": "It's still twenty-five minutes early.", "completion": "I want to \"make love\" to him."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!", "completion": "Look, maybe that's him!"}
{"prompt": "God, I think Josh is too mature for us.", "completion": "I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man."}
{"prompt": "What does it stand for?", "completion": "Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP."}
{"prompt": "You're better at it.", "completion": "I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for \"dwarf!\""}

{"prompt": "Hey! We forgot to call the loser!", "completion": "Which loser?"}
{"prompt": "That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?", "completion": "Fuck you!"}
{"prompt": "I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.", "completion": "What are you talking about -- who?"}
{"prompt": "No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!", "completion": "I want to do him!"}
{"prompt": "There's my dad with Joanie.", "completion": "I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?"}
{"prompt": "Look, that's back when I hated you.", "completion": "I remember every minute of that party."}
{"prompt": "Look at how cute I am!", "completion": "What a little hosebag."}
{"prompt": "You lent it to me in like tenth grade.", "completion": "I've been looking all over for this."}
{"prompt": "I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.", "completion": "Hey - why do you have this?"}
{"prompt": "Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.", "completion": "What is this?"}
{"prompt": "Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.", "completion": "So what should we do?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, we totally have to.", "completion": "Does Oomie really like this show?"}
{"prompt": "I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.", "completion": "We should call him and pretend to be the redhead."}
{"prompt": "Jesus! Listen to this one: \"Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?\"", "completion": "God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him."}

{"prompt": "Or maybe not.", "completion": "Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --"}

{"prompt": "God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.", "completion": "I know, it hasn't really hit me yet."}
{"prompt": "Did you sign up yet?", "completion": "Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest."}

{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Just look at them!"}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists."}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing."}

{"prompt": "Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?", "completion": "How perfect."}

{"prompt": "Shut up!", "completion": "Uh oh... don't turn around..."}
{"prompt": "Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.", "completion": "Unless they're in your Summer school class!"}

{"prompt": "Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an \"F\" that means you have to take the class over again.", "completion": "You loser."}
{"prompt": "These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.", "completion": "It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma..."}
{"prompt": "God, what a bunch of retards...", "completion": "I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up."}
{"prompt": "Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.", "completion": "See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid."}
{"prompt": "Just because.", "completion": "What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?"}
{"prompt": "We're not.", "completion": "Really? Both of you?... Why not?"}
{"prompt": "What about me? Am I not even here?", "completion": "Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!"}
{"prompt": "Well, we won't keep you.", "completion": "I love this place... it's so - you know, \"funky.\""}

{"prompt": "So what are you guys doing this Summer?", "completion": "Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!", "completion": "Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing."}

{"prompt": "Shhh!", "completion": "I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!"}
{"prompt": "I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.", "completion": "May I ask what you're doing?"}
{"prompt": "Where did you get those pants?", "completion": "It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl."}
{"prompt": "It's kind of falling apart.", "completion": "Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room."}
{"prompt": "I thought it wasn't for sale.", "completion": "I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go..."}
{"prompt": "Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.", "completion": "You still interested in that?"}
{"prompt": "Seymour does.", "completion": "Who does?"}
{"prompt": "That's okay...", "completion": "Do you have any other old records besides these?"}
{"prompt": "Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.", "completion": "Perhaps the \"Jam-in-ator\" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button."}

{"prompt": "You don't know what you're talking about.", "completion": "Didn't they tell you?"}

{"prompt": "You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.", "completion": "I did too!"}

{"prompt": "What are you doing here?", "completion": "I had to see you."}
{"prompt": "...What do you mean?", "completion": "Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more."}
{"prompt": "I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...", "completion": "I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour."}
{"prompt": "In what way do you mean?", "completion": "In whatever way you think I mean."}
{"prompt": "No, of course not.", "completion": "So, do you like me, Seymour?"}
{"prompt": "I... I don't think so.", "completion": "Does that mean you don't like me?"}
{"prompt": "Just someone so young...", "completion": "You must have done something to make her think you like me."}
{"prompt": "No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...", "completion": "What does she mean by that - \"somebody like me\"?"}
{"prompt": "No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --", "completion": "What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...", "completion": "So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.", "completion": "And you like them?"}
{"prompt": "Well when can we do something?", "completion": "It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know..."}
{"prompt": "Well forget the art show... let's do something else.", "completion": "I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --"}
{"prompt": "Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.", "completion": "...I better not..."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...", "completion": "I... I don't know. I don't really think I should..."}
{"prompt": "...so... is he your boyfriend now?", "completion": "Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time..."}
{"prompt": "I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --", "completion": "I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally..."}
{"prompt": "No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --", "completion": "Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?"}
{"prompt": "We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --", "completion": "What, are you trying to get rid of me?"}
{"prompt": "Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...", "completion": "Sounds good..."}
{"prompt": "Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...", "completion": "So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?"}
{"prompt": "I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...", "completion": "Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?"}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?"}
{"prompt": "YAAA!", "completion": "Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you..."}
{"prompt": "Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!", "completion": "Boo!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...", "completion": "What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?"}
{"prompt": "Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...", "completion": "What? You're kidding me..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, hi...", "completion": "So, what happened?"}
{"prompt": "Uh... hello?", "completion": "Hi, it's me..."}
{"prompt": "How can you be so sure?", "completion": "Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!"}
{"prompt": "Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.", "completion": "Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!"}
{"prompt": "It's just somebody's idea of a joke...", "completion": "That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?"}
{"prompt": "Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...", "completion": "Wow!  What was that all about?"}
{"prompt": "Who knows?", "completion": "Aren't you going to get that?"}
{"prompt": "I won't even dignify that with a response.", "completion": "I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah?", "completion": "Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out."}
{"prompt": "Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.", "completion": "Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation..."}
{"prompt": "I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.", "completion": "I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Never..."}
{"prompt": "That's the spirit!", "completion": "I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!"}
{"prompt": "Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.", "completion": "Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships..."}
{"prompt": "Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...", "completion": "What, like a girdle?"}
{"prompt": "It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...", "completion": "What is that?"}
{"prompt": "Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...", "completion": "Are you okay?"}
{"prompt": "Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...", "completion": "No, Doofus... blow it out!"}
{"prompt": "Don't you trust me, Seymour?", "completion": "You can open your eyes now."}
{"prompt": "I promise I'll take good care of it.", "completion": "I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --"}
{"prompt": "Hey, can I borrow this?", "completion": "What? Why?"}
{"prompt": "So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?", "completion": "No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but still...", "completion": "I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.", "completion": "Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me..."}
{"prompt": "What are you, a fry cook or something?", "completion": "Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters."}
{"prompt": "You work at Cook's Chicken?", "completion": "For nineteen years..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well \"Cook's\" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named \"The Coon Chicken Inn\" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.", "completion": "Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?", "completion": "\"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS\"!"}
{"prompt": "What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.", "completion": "What, are you a klansman or something?"}
{"prompt": "I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...", "completion": "What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?"}
{"prompt": "Wow, this is so cool...", "completion": "If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?"}
{"prompt": "It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.", "completion": "\"Yet.\""}
{"prompt": "Hooray for me.", "completion": "I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --"}
{"prompt": "But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...", "completion": "I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.", "completion": "Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless..."}
{"prompt": "Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.", "completion": "It's not hopeless..."}
{"prompt": "Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.", "completion": "We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all."}
{"prompt": "I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.", "completion": "Jesus..."}
{"prompt": "Just wait here.", "completion": "What did you tell that girl?"}
{"prompt": "Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?", "completion": "Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No..."}
{"prompt": "Jesus, Seymour.", "completion": "Yes, that would certainly do..."}
{"prompt": "I'm not holding my breath in that department.", "completion": "What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?"}
{"prompt": "I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!", "completion": "This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from."}
{"prompt": "That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...", "completion": "So, why did you bring this along?"}
{"prompt": "C'mon, Seymour, please?", "completion": "Relax, Seymour, relax..."}
{"prompt": "These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.", "completion": "Uh, I don't have much money with me right now."}
{"prompt": "OH MY GOD!", "completion": "Look at this -- \"Lollipop Lolitas\" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?"}
{"prompt": "Wow! Look at all these creeps!", "completion": "Shh!"}
{"prompt": "I really don't think it's a good idea.", "completion": "Fine, I'll go by myself then..."}
{"prompt": "I don't think so...", "completion": "PLEASE? We have to!"}
{"prompt": "I - I'd really rather not...", "completion": "We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure... very funny....", "completion": "Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?"}
{"prompt": "Well are --", "completion": "Oh my god! We have to go in here!"}
{"prompt": "So is that your boyfriend?", "completion": "Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture."}
{"prompt": "Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...", "completion": "Let's just say \"music\" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?", "completion": "Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance."}
{"prompt": "I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...", "completion": "We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests."}
{"prompt": "I'm just not one of those guys who has a \"type\"...", "completion": "Every guy has a type!"}
{"prompt": "Jesus!", "completion": "C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?"}
{"prompt": "I really didn't get a good look at her.", "completion": "Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...", "completion": "But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --", "completion": "What about her? Would you go out with her?"}
{"prompt": "I appreciate the offer but you really don't --", "completion": "Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well...", "completion": "I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!"}
{"prompt": "Good luck...", "completion": "I'm totally serious!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, right...", "completion": "No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.", "completion": "I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!"}
{"prompt": "You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.", "completion": "No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour."}
{"prompt": "Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.", "completion": "Oh, come on! What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...", "completion": "God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...", "completion": "Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!"}
{"prompt": "Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.", "completion": "Really? Can I see it?"}
{"prompt": "I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.", "completion": "You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I was only kidding!", "completion": "What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?"}
{"prompt": "Oops! I dropped it!", "completion": "NO!!!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure, I guess...", "completion": "Watch my stuff."}
{"prompt": "Wow!", "completion": "Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it..."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, \"Devil Got My Woman\" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?", "completion": "The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --", "completion": "So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?"}
{"prompt": "A dollar seventy-five.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Wow!", "completion": "How much is it?"}
{"prompt": "Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.", "completion": "This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue."}
{"prompt": "Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.", "completion": "Is this one any good?"}
{"prompt": "There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?", "completion": "Sure, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?", "completion": "Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records..."}
{"prompt": "You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.", "completion": "I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect \"foreign.\""}
{"prompt": "Do you have any old Indian records?", "completion": "Indian records?"}
{"prompt": "Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!", "completion": "Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you."}
{"prompt": "So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?", "completion": "They're Seymour's."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.", "completion": "No problem."}
{"prompt": "Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.", "completion": "Maybe she's got another boyfriend."}
{"prompt": "Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?", "completion": "Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back."}
{"prompt": "Well, here's where the fun never stops!", "completion": "Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Call me sometime."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could see him.", "completion": "Did you remember to pay the phone bill?"}
{"prompt": "He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!", "completion": "I agree."}
{"prompt": "Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.", "completion": "So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?"}
{"prompt": "I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!", "completion": "Please Josh?"}
{"prompt": "This shocking image of repressed femininity!", "completion": "Right, exactly!"}
{"prompt": "Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?", "completion": "I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like..."}
{"prompt": "I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?", "completion": "It's a \"found object\"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art."}
{"prompt": "What do we have here, Margaret?", "completion": "It's a tampon in a teacup..."}
{"prompt": "It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.", "completion": "Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier."}
{"prompt": "I am.", "completion": "Talk to us about it..."}
{"prompt": "What fake blind date? What are you talking about?", "completion": "I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?"}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological..."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "On that pathetic fake blind date."}
{"prompt": "Did she say that?", "completion": "Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you."}
{"prompt": "Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?", "completion": "Yeah, she thinks you're a dork."}
{"prompt": "Really, I don't know enough about it to...", "completion": "That slut!"}
{"prompt": "I have no idea - I just want to...", "completion": "Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy."}
{"prompt": "She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...", "completion": "What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Why? What did she tell you?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe she's with Josh?", "completion": "Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?"}
{"prompt": "Why would she be hiding from me?", "completion": "I don't know... where is she, then?"}
{"prompt": "Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.", "completion": "Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you."}
{"prompt": "No... they said she was here...", "completion": "What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!"}
{"prompt": "Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?", "completion": "She's not at home?"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Do you have a check for me?"}
{"prompt": "Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.", "completion": "Seymour?"}
{"prompt": "Why don't we start with that next week?", "completion": "Thank you, doctor."}
{"prompt": "Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!", "completion": "It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage..."}
{"prompt": "So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?", "completion": "Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it."}
{"prompt": "-careful, Abdullah-", "completion": "I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit."}
{"prompt": "I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-", "completion": "-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-"}
{"prompt": "-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-", "completion": "-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-"}
{"prompt": "As are they all.", "completion": "The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-"}
{"prompt": "You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee-", "completion": "Morning, friend, glorious day."}
{"prompt": "He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.", "completion": "He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about."}
{"prompt": "-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-", "completion": "You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-"}
{"prompt": "On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights.", "completion": "-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-"}
{"prompt": "Oh, you're a doctor now, too?", "completion": "There is no reason for fear."}
{"prompt": "-malaria epidemic; very sudden.", "completion": "Let me see the sick."}
{"prompt": "We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.", "completion": "You were contracted to work-"}
{"prompt": "Starting now, we attack them.", "completion": "How; we don't know where they are?"}
{"prompt": "Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.", "completion": "I think it's been a pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Am I to take it you want to live?", "completion": "Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes."}
{"prompt": "You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.", "completion": "I am a man of peace."}
{"prompt": "No hints, Samuel.", "completion": "You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo."}
{"prompt": "Understand, I had help-", "completion": "-not a time for modesty, Bob-"}
{"prompt": "Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.", "completion": "Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me."}
{"prompt": "All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?", "completion": "I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him."}
{"prompt": "You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?", "completion": "Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job."}
{"prompt": "And it worked?", "completion": "In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound."}
{"prompt": "Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?", "completion": "I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger."}
{"prompt": "In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.", "completion": "Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him."}
{"prompt": "This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?", "completion": "I'm calling it my \"contraption\"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door."}
{"prompt": "It hasn't been that simple so far.", "completion": "What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed?"}
{"prompt": "It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-", "completion": "-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?"}
{"prompt": "Yes he is.", "completion": "Well, I need to speak to him."}
{"prompt": "Starling?", "completion": "Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?"}
{"prompt": "But overall, you're pleased?", "completion": "I do need to see Starling."}
{"prompt": "So work must be going well?", "completion": "Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa."}
{"prompt": "Lovely sound- they seem happy.", "completion": "Don't they, though?"}
{"prompt": "Pleasant journey?", "completion": "How could it be? I hate Africa."}
{"prompt": "Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.", "completion": "You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch."}
{"prompt": "You'll need your confidence, I promise you.", "completion": "I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes."}
{"prompt": "You've never built in Africa.", "completion": "But I have in India- every country presents problems."}
{"prompt": "-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?", "completion": "I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge."}
{"prompt": "My wife is the game player in the family, sir.", "completion": "Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me."}
{"prompt": "Then why do it?", "completion": "John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?"}
{"prompt": "You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.", "completion": "You don't enjoy killing, do you?"}
{"prompt": "I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?", "completion": "Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight."}
{"prompt": "Then why do you stay?", "completion": "Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift."}
{"prompt": "You intend \"sorting this out\" tonight?", "completion": "This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer."}
{"prompt": "-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-", "completion": "-please- you needn't be so graphic-"}
{"prompt": "A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?", "completion": "Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off."}
{"prompt": "You never had it.", "completion": "Nigel and I don't like each other much."}
{"prompt": "Then we agree.", "completion": "I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, \"don't get sick in front of it.\"  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack."}
{"prompt": "I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.", "completion": "I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived."}
{"prompt": "-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.", "completion": "Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?"}
{"prompt": "I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.", "completion": "That's a terrible idea-"}
{"prompt": "-not \"what if\"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our \"son\" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.", "completion": "Go, now.  Such a gentleman."}
{"prompt": "-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.", "completion": "What if there are complications?-"}
{"prompt": "Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-", "completion": "-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-"}
{"prompt": "Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?", "completion": "It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments."}
{"prompt": "I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.", "completion": "We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena."}
{"prompt": "-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-", "completion": "I assure you we came close many times-"}
{"prompt": "Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-", "completion": "-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-"}
{"prompt": "All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.", "completion": "That is correct.  Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Very good indeed.", "completion": "We have hunted since childhood."}
{"prompt": "You mean nobody died?", "completion": "We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?"}
{"prompt": "But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?", "completion": "What a good week."}
{"prompt": "Second death? Where?-", "completion": "-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh."}
{"prompt": "But you said they were always old.", "completion": "That's what the books say..."}
{"prompt": "Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-", "completion": "I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size."}
{"prompt": "In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.", "completion": "John, it will not be easy."}
{"prompt": "All right- thee second embankment will go there.", "completion": "You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -\"there.\""}
{"prompt": "Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.", "completion": "Possibly."}
{"prompt": "-true enough- but without the comedy relief.", "completion": "How lucky we are."}
{"prompt": "So that's what a lion looks like.", "completion": "With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-"}
{"prompt": "Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.", "completion": "...one shot..."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?"}
{"prompt": "That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.", "completion": "John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-"}
{"prompt": "I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-", "completion": "-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel."}
{"prompt": "I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.", "completion": "Shhh."}
{"prompt": "I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.", "completion": "Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed!"}
{"prompt": "Might be exciting for you.", "completion": "I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?"}
{"prompt": "We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.", "completion": "I don't suppose I could watch."}
{"prompt": "Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.", "completion": "You said \"of course\" you'd need the donkey. Why \"of course\"?"}
{"prompt": "Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.", "completion": "I couldn't believe it when you said \"sort it out.\" As if it were the most normal thing in the world. \"Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway.\""}
{"prompt": "Finish your tour?", "completion": "And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?"}
{"prompt": "Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?", "completion": "I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done."}
{"prompt": "Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.", "completion": "Does he speak English?"}
{"prompt": "We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.", "completion": "Have you got that in writing?"}
{"prompt": "Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.", "completion": "Beaumont says it's to end slavery."}
{"prompt": "I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?", "completion": "Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life."}
{"prompt": "Anything special about them?", "completion": "Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble."}
{"prompt": "Don't much like them.", "completion": "The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young."}
{"prompt": "He just gave me his \"monster\" speech.", "completion": "That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking."}
{"prompt": "Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came.", "completion": "Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that."}
{"prompt": "I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.", "completion": "Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me."}
{"prompt": "How many do you think they've killed?", "completion": "The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Because I think they're after you."}
{"prompt": "You think they'll come then?  Why?", "completion": "Good luck."}
{"prompt": "Was that supposed to make me feel better?", "completion": "It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you."}
{"prompt": "I'll have to.", "completion": "I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me."}
{"prompt": "I'll be bait alone?", "completion": "Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?"}
{"prompt": "They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.", "completion": "Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night."}
{"prompt": "Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?", "completion": "Don't they have to be?..."}
{"prompt": "Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?", "completion": "Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure."}
{"prompt": "What happened to them?", "completion": "I got big."}
{"prompt": "You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...", "completion": "In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed."}
{"prompt": "In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.", "completion": "It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I\tsuppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and..."}
{"prompt": "Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.", "completion": "But of course yours worked."}
{"prompt": "Goddammit!", "completion": "It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there."}
{"prompt": "Have you ever failed?", "completion": "Only in life..."}
{"prompt": "...don't know...", "completion": "Think about something else."}
{"prompt": "...misfire... it jammed...", "completion": "Has it ever done that before?"}
{"prompt": "It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.", "completion": "You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you."}
{"prompt": "I can try.", "completion": "Samuel says you killed a lion."}
{"prompt": "No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.", "completion": "The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?"}
{"prompt": "I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.", "completion": "Have you got it?"}
{"prompt": "I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.", "completion": "That's very considerate."}
{"prompt": "All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.", "completion": "Somehow I guessed."}
{"prompt": "Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?", "completion": "Actually, no."}
{"prompt": "Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.", "completion": "We need to talk."}
{"prompt": "What did I do?", "completion": "Got me out of trouble."}
{"prompt": "It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-", "completion": "I didn't have a chance to thank you."}
{"prompt": "Underneath.  Somewhere.", "completion": "Afraid of lions."}
{"prompt": "Once...", "completion": "Where is it?"}
{"prompt": "I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.", "completion": "He has children?"}
{"prompt": "He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...", "completion": "Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once."}
{"prompt": "Since his beard was red.", "completion": "Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes. But it takes time.", "completion": "You've known him long?"}
{"prompt": "I have to ask- why do you need me?", "completion": "You like him, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "You give me hope, John.", "completion": "Soon."}
{"prompt": "Do you love her?", "completion": "I do, actually; very much."}
{"prompt": "Good news?", "completion": "I expect so- it's from my wife."}
{"prompt": "For you.", "completion": "Thank you, Samuel."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, I think so.", "completion": "Look out, Samuel, here it comes."}
{"prompt": "We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.", "completion": "Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge."}
{"prompt": "Nonsense.", "completion": "You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means \"slaughter\"..."}
{"prompt": "What are they looking at?", "completion": "You- they cannot believe you're still here."}
{"prompt": "I am also liaison between these two.", "completion": "Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?"}
{"prompt": "Did it look like this in your mind?", "completion": "This is more difficult-"}
{"prompt": "The workers don't get on?", "completion": "Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them."}
{"prompt": "It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.", "completion": "Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly."}
{"prompt": "Why do the workers look unhappy?", "completion": "Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge."}
{"prompt": "Some mysteries should not have solutions.", "completion": "Hold your son high."}
{"prompt": "Help finish the railroad.", "completion": "My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell."}
{"prompt": "Where do you go next?", "completion": "Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?"}
{"prompt": "And where will you sleep beautifully?", "completion": "Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible."}
{"prompt": "Not even close.  What happened?", "completion": "Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there."}
{"prompt": "Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.", "completion": "Did you ever see a lion that size?"}
{"prompt": "They will want a lot of money.", "completion": "Why so many?"}
{"prompt": "How many cattle?", "completion": "Four should do it."}
{"prompt": "Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?", "completion": "I don't believe you had a mother."}
{"prompt": "Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.", "completion": "I'd rather not."}
{"prompt": "I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.", "completion": "I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child."}
{"prompt": "Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.", "completion": "We don't have a relationship."}
{"prompt": "Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!", "completion": "I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby."}
{"prompt": "I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.", "completion": "Everybody has a choice."}
{"prompt": "No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?", "completion": "If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.", "completion": "What do you want with my baby?"}
{"prompt": "Good night, Janosz.", "completion": "Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?"}
{"prompt": "No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.", "completion": "Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?", "completion": "Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.", "completion": "Janosz?"}
{"prompt": "Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?", "completion": "I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time."}
{"prompt": "We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?", "completion": "Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go."}
{"prompt": "You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.", "completion": "Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz."}
{"prompt": "Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.", "completion": "I won't."}
{"prompt": "This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?", "completion": "Certainly."}
{"prompt": "Does he ever mention me?", "completion": "No.  Not that I can recall."}
{"prompt": "How is he these days?", "completion": "Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border."}
{"prompt": "Do you ever see him?", "completion": "Occasionally"}
{"prompt": "Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.", "completion": "Oh no."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.", "completion": "We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you."}
{"prompt": "I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.", "completion": "What are you working on, Egon?"}
{"prompt": "That's exactly what you said last week.", "completion": "Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this."}
{"prompt": "No, you didn't, Frank.", "completion": "Okay, that's no problem."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.", "completion": "Didn't I do it?"}
{"prompt": "Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?", "completion": "That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett."}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.", "completion": "Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually."}
{"prompt": "I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.", "completion": "You're also a human being, Frank."}
{"prompt": "So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.", "completion": "Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?"}
{"prompt": "Same difference.", "completion": "That's a terrible thing to say."}
{"prompt": "Finally came to your senses, huh?", "completion": "That's not true.  It was 1620."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.", "completion": "I think he likes you.  I think I do too."}
{"prompt": "Let me jingle you right now.", "completion": "Maybe I should call Janine."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.", "completion": "So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not even good for me.", "completion": "Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know."}
{"prompt": "All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?", "completion": "Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know."}
{"prompt": "Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?", "completion": "For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?"}
{"prompt": "So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?", "completion": "I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me."}
{"prompt": "I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.", "completion": "I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty."}
{"prompt": "Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.", "completion": "Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?"}
{"prompt": "Does she know anything about babies?", "completion": "Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities."}
{"prompt": "I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.", "completion": "It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees."}
{"prompt": "They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?", "completion": "Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it."}
{"prompt": "Are you all squeaky clean now?", "completion": "Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.", "completion": "I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!"}
{"prompt": "How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.", "completion": "Or we could do that."}
{"prompt": "Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?", "completion": "For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night."}
{"prompt": "Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.", "completion": "Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here."}
{"prompt": "Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.", "completion": "Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things."}
{"prompt": "We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.", "completion": "It was full of this awful pink ooze."}
{"prompt": "This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.", "completion": "Peter, what about the bathtub?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know what to do anymore.", "completion": "I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here."}
{"prompt": "I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.", "completion": "Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?"}
{"prompt": "Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.", "completion": "You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?", "completion": "No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?"}
{"prompt": "Good-bye, Peter.", "completion": "I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.", "completion": "I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy."}
{"prompt": "As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.", "completion": "He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage."}
{"prompt": "I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.", "completion": "I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art."}
{"prompt": "Oh, hello, Peter.", "completion": "You're really good, you know."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "So this is what you do, huh?"}
{"prompt": "I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.", "completion": "Good luck."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.", "completion": "You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?"}
{"prompt": "You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?", "completion": "Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison."}
{"prompt": "Okay, let's take a look.", "completion": "I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here."}
{"prompt": "We definitely had a moment or two.", "completion": "That's where the buggy stopped."}
{"prompt": "I'll supervise.", "completion": "Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?"}
{"prompt": "Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.", "completion": "I'll do it."}
{"prompt": "Oscar!  You poor kid!", "completion": "Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him."}
{"prompt": "There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?", "completion": "His name is Oscar."}
{"prompt": "I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.", "completion": "Well, when you started introducing me as \"the old ball and chain,\" that's when I left."}
{"prompt": "He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.", "completion": "You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep."}
{"prompt": "So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.", "completion": "He didn't \"ditch\" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it."}
{"prompt": "I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.", "completion": "I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Peter.", "completion": "You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry!", "completion": "Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.", "completion": "Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things."}
{"prompt": "Is this the spot?", "completion": "A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped."}
{"prompt": "No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.", "completion": "Hi, Egon."}
{"prompt": "No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.", "completion": "Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming."}
{"prompt": "Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?", "completion": "It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter."}
{"prompt": "Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?", "completion": "I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.", "completion": "According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016."}
{"prompt": "Now you're talking.", "completion": "Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.", "completion": "Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?"}
{"prompt": "Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?", "completion": "That's quite a story."}
{"prompt": "I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?", "completion": "No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you."}
{"prompt": "I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?", "completion": "I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him."}
{"prompt": "Can I help you?", "completion": "Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.", "completion": "You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck."}
{"prompt": "You're right.  We should stay.", "completion": "I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?"}
{"prompt": "Should we go?", "completion": "I don't think we should leave her alone."}
{"prompt": "Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?", "completion": "Tonight?"}
{"prompt": "You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.", "completion": "So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe a person could actually live like this.", "completion": "So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?", "completion": "Oh, sure, that sounds great."}
{"prompt": "Well, good night, Louis.", "completion": "Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?"}
{"prompt": "No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.", "completion": "That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.", "completion": "Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve."}
{"prompt": "I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.", "completion": "Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?"}
{"prompt": "Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.", "completion": "What are you doing up here?"}
{"prompt": "Who are you going to call?", "completion": "Ghostbusters."}
{"prompt": "It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.", "completion": "Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.", "completion": "What is it, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.", "completion": "You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.", "completion": "So you see, everything is in order, is it not?"}
{"prompt": "This is the one that looked at Dana.", "completion": "It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --"}
{"prompt": "You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?", "completion": "The Upper West Side."}
{"prompt": "Then why have you come?", "completion": "We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.", "completion": "My pleasure."}
{"prompt": "We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.", "completion": "Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you."}
{"prompt": "Too bad for the Moldavians.", "completion": NaN}
{"prompt": "How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?", "completion": "It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century."}
{"prompt": "So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.", "completion": "Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television."}
{"prompt": "The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.", "completion": "Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?"}
{"prompt": "I command you.", "completion": "I await the word of Vigo."}
{"prompt": "-- the sorrow of Moldavia --", "completion": "-- the sorrow --"}
{"prompt": "I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --", "completion": "Yes, the scourge --"}
{"prompt": "Command me, lord.", "completion": "On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again."}
{"prompt": "You've got to stop them.  Please!", "completion": "I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you."}
{"prompt": "Maybe they just want to appeal.", "completion": "These boys aren't playing around."}
{"prompt": "Who are they?", "completion": "They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.", "completion": "You've got to do something!"}
{"prompt": "Did I forget something?", "completion": "Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt."}
{"prompt": "Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.", "completion": "That's it?  That's all you have to say?"}
{"prompt": "Can I have some of your water?", "completion": "Get on with it, counselor!"}
{"prompt": "Your honor, may I approach the bench?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?", "completion": "Do I?"}
{"prompt": "The witness is leading him.  Sustained.", "completion": "Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?"}
{"prompt": "I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.", "completion": "I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones."}
{"prompt": "Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --", "completion": "Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there."}
{"prompt": "Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.", "completion": "This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.", "completion": "I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm."}
{"prompt": "You were the one who got me in.", "completion": "I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?"}
{"prompt": "Like what?", "completion": "I got you out of those bad tax shelters."}
{"prompt": "I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.", "completion": "Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you."}
{"prompt": "I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.", "completion": "Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor."}
{"prompt": "Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?", "completion": "Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you."}
{"prompt": "This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.", "completion": "This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve."}
{"prompt": "Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?", "completion": "I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve."}
{"prompt": "Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?", "completion": "Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger."}
{"prompt": "So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?", "completion": "No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it."}
{"prompt": "I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.", "completion": "I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in."}
{"prompt": "So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.", "completion": "Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I did.  We were city champs.", "completion": "Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial."}
{"prompt": "They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.", "completion": "Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town."}
{"prompt": "It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.", "completion": "From where -- Neptune?"}
{"prompt": "I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.", "completion": "Pretty impressive, huh?"}
{"prompt": "They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.", "completion": "So far so good."}
{"prompt": "This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.", "completion": "It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing."}
{"prompt": "Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?", "completion": "Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?"}
{"prompt": "It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.", "completion": "You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population."}
{"prompt": "A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.", "completion": "That's it?  \"I'll be back?\""}
{"prompt": "You need the exercise.", "completion": "\"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --\""}
{"prompt": "I knew that.", "completion": "You were supposed to help me with this."}
{"prompt": "Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.", "completion": "That's a thousand million electron volts."}
{"prompt": "What now, Brainiac?", "completion": "I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to have a stool specimen", "completion": "Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?"}
{"prompt": "I think they're more interested in my epididymis.", "completion": "I don't even want to know where that is."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Venkman.", "completion": "How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Do it!  Just do it!", "completion": "Egon!"}
{"prompt": "Something good --", "completion": "Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!"}
{"prompt": "We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --", "completion": "Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --"}
{"prompt": "It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.", "completion": "I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it."}
{"prompt": "If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.", "completion": "Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you."}
{"prompt": "That's it.  It's on the bottom.", "completion": "Nine feet -- ten --"}
{"prompt": "This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, \"Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back.\"", "completion": "Six feet -- seven -- eight --"}
{"prompt": "And we're the ...", "completion": "No, not exactly a man of the people.  \"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy.\""}
{"prompt": "It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.", "completion": "I'm Egon --"}
{"prompt": "His nickname is \"The Hammer.\"", "completion": "Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there."}
{"prompt": "What's the reading?", "completion": "Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?"}
{"prompt": "The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.", "completion": "This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole."}
{"prompt": "Nothing.  Not a trace.", "completion": "Why don't we try the Giga-meter?"}
{"prompt": "You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.", "completion": "Good idea."}
{"prompt": "Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?", "completion": "This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses."}
{"prompt": "There's something very familiar about this painting.", "completion": "Who was that?"}
{"prompt": "And it's all flowing toward the museum.", "completion": "Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi."}
{"prompt": "No, the slime is rising.", "completion": "Rivers of the stuff!"}
{"prompt": "I'd put my money on that Vigo character.", "completion": "Is the line sinking?"}
{"prompt": "You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?", "completion": "There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red."}
{"prompt": "Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.", "completion": "We've found it at every event site we've been to lately."}
{"prompt": "Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?", "completion": "What's your story, Pete?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.", "completion": "My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived."}
{"prompt": "The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.", "completion": "I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "She's new in town.", "completion": "Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey."}
{"prompt": "We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.", "completion": "My Fault!"}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.", "completion": "I don't think they make Nikes in her size."}
{"prompt": "Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?", "completion": "I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th."}
{"prompt": "Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?", "completion": "I hope we have enough stuff to do the job."}
{"prompt": "I hate Jello.", "completion": "Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff."}
{"prompt": "It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.", "completion": "It looks like a giant Jello mold."}
{"prompt": "You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!", "completion": "Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place."}
{"prompt": "I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.", "completion": "Okay, but you're missing all the fun."}
{"prompt": "We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.", "completion": "Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations."}
{"prompt": "You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.", "completion": "Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?"}
{"prompt": "I'll get one more reading.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:", "completion": "Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here."}
{"prompt": "You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?", "completion": "Did you find anything at Dana's?"}
{"prompt": "What kind of tests?", "completion": "Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --"}
{"prompt": "Like a goat on garbage.", "completion": "We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction."}
{"prompt": "This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.", "completion": "'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.", "completion": "This is what you do with your spare time?"}
{"prompt": "It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?", "completion": "And now you're going to eat it?"}
{"prompt": "If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.", "completion": "Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you."}
{"prompt": "I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.", "completion": "You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?"}
{"prompt": "Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.", "completion": "Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?"}
{"prompt": "I'm Ray --", "completion": "I'm Peter --"}
{"prompt": "Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.", "completion": "Okay, let's heat 'em up!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.", "completion": "Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile."}
{"prompt": "Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.", "completion": "I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one."}
{"prompt": "It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Dana!  Dana Barrett!", "completion": "Well, Holmes, what do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!", "completion": "Who, Ray?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Ray --", "completion": "Who?  Who?  Who?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "Who?  Just -- someone we know."}
{"prompt": "Great.  So what are you guys working on?", "completion": "Oh, just checking something for an old friend."}
{"prompt": "Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?", "completion": "Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something."}
{"prompt": "So, no goat hooves, huh?", "completion": "I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.", "completion": "Oh, hiya, Pete."}
{"prompt": "Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?", "completion": "Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life."}
{"prompt": "She's moving!", "completion": "I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk."}
{"prompt": "What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.", "completion": "Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil."}
{"prompt": "You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.", "completion": "Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it."}
{"prompt": "Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?", "completion": "Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line."}
{"prompt": "Are you all right?", "completion": "Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys."}
{"prompt": "No, I just thought --", "completion": "Well don't think!"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.", "completion": "Are you telling me how to drive?"}
{"prompt": "What?  Yeah.", "completion": "Are you all right?  You coming down with something?"}
{"prompt": "Huh?  What?", "completion": "You finished here?"}
{"prompt": "Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal \"Stabilize -- All Clear.\"", "completion": "Now that's one ugly dude."}
{"prompt": "I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.", "completion": "You got a flux and a half."}
{"prompt": "It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.", "completion": "And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.", "completion": "Does it have any favorites?"}
{"prompt": "Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.", "completion": "Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.", "completion": "Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are."}
{"prompt": "Then let's do it.", "completion": "That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds."}
{"prompt": "Ready?", "completion": "I'm ready."}
{"prompt": "My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?", "completion": "Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12."}
{"prompt": "How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.", "completion": "It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card."}
{"prompt": "Wonder what?", "completion": "If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know."}
{"prompt": "And decent.", "completion": "Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?"}
{"prompt": "You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?", "completion": "And pure --"}
{"prompt": "I don't think he's ready for the toaster.", "completion": "It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch."}
{"prompt": "So we'll put a warning on the label.", "completion": "Tell him about the toaster."}
{"prompt": "I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.", "completion": "Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand."}
{"prompt": "Uuuuuuugh!!", "completion": "What's the matter, dear?"}
{"prompt": "Have I done the right thing?", "completion": "Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!"}
{"prompt": "Now where are you going?", "completion": "To the bathroom, where do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.", "completion": "I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!"}
{"prompt": "Well, thanks a lot.", "completion": "Roy?  Your clock broke."}
{"prompt": "Aren't you glad we waited?", "completion": "I don't know.  It probably would've been the same."}
{"prompt": "Eight o'clock?", "completion": "I was just going to say \"eight.\"  You're fantastic!"}
{"prompt": "Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.", "completion": "Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me."}
{"prompt": "Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.", "completion": "Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?"}
{"prompt": "No.  They're just coming to me.", "completion": "Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up."}
{"prompt": "Ummm -- figure eight?", "completion": "Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?"}
{"prompt": "It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.", "completion": "Ready?  What is it?"}
{"prompt": "All right, what happened to me?", "completion": "Is it a star?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.", "completion": "I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway."}
{"prompt": "Are you the Gatekeeper?", "completion": "I am Zuul."}
{"prompt": "Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.", "completion": "I got the Twister game for later ..."}
{"prompt": "Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.", "completion": "Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Louis.", "completion": "Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party."}
{"prompt": "I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.", "completion": "Oh, Dana, it's you."}
{"prompt": "Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.", "completion": "You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager."}
{"prompt": "No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.", "completion": "Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ..."}
{"prompt": "Are you sick, Louis?", "completion": "Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped \"20 Minute Workout\" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"}
{"prompt": "Hi, Louis.", "completion": "... I thought it was the drug store."}
{"prompt": "Talk to my accountant.", "completion": "Oh, Dana, it's you ..."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.", "completion": "This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high."}
{"prompt": "Really!  Is it gone?", "completion": "Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work."}
{"prompt": "Whoa!! Nice voice.", "completion": "Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen."}
{"prompt": "Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...", "completion": "There is no Dana.  I am Zuul."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.", "completion": "I am Zuul.  I am ..."}
{"prompt": "Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.", "completion": "I want you inside me."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.", "completion": "Take me now."}
{"prompt": "Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.", "completion": "Do you want this body?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?", "completion": "He is the Destructor."}
{"prompt": "I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.", "completion": "We must prepare for the coming of Gozer."}
{"prompt": "I've got to go now.", "completion": "Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?"}
{"prompt": "All right.  Since you put it that way.", "completion": "I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat."}
{"prompt": "I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.", "completion": "You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser."}
{"prompt": "What's he doing in my refrigerator.", "completion": "I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  \"Zuul was the Minion of Gozer.\"", "completion": "\"Gozer\" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods."}
{"prompt": "You must have gotten the last copy.", "completion": "Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?"}
{"prompt": "Can't you tell me now?", "completion": "I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name \"Zuul\" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it."}
{"prompt": "He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?", "completion": "Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant."}
{"prompt": "The \"stiff?\"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.", "completion": "Is he dying or something?"}
{"prompt": "I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?", "completion": "Who's the stiff?"}
{"prompt": "Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.", "completion": "I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me."}
{"prompt": "You heard it?", "completion": "You're the best one in your row."}
{"prompt": "No kiss?", "completion": "Great rehearsal."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Then I'll go.", "completion": "Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.", "completion": "All right."}
{"prompt": "Don't scream.", "completion": "Then leave."}
{"prompt": "I want to help you.", "completion": "I'll scream."}
{"prompt": "On a purely scientific basis.", "completion": "Out!"}
{"prompt": "I think I should spend the night here.", "completion": "That's it.  Get out."}
{"prompt": "I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.", "completion": "All right.  What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt": "If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.", "completion": "Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.", "completion": "This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy."}
{"prompt": "Are you all right?", "completion": "Yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt": "I know.  It happened by itself.", "completion": "Damn!"}
{"prompt": "You're quite a housekeeper.", "completion": "I told you, I ..."}
{"prompt": "Well, let's check it out.", "completion": "I'll wait here if you don't mind."}
{"prompt": "Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?", "completion": "Uh-huh."}
{"prompt": "That's too bad.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Like a used car salesman.", "completion": "Thanks.  What's in there?"}
{"prompt": "You really don't act like a scientist.", "completion": "No?  What do I act like?"}
{"prompt": "That's a violin concerto.", "completion": "Yeah, but it's got a great cello break."}
{"prompt": "Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?", "completion": "I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto."}
{"prompt": "No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.", "completion": "You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument."}
{"prompt": "Spengler,  see if you can find the word \"Zuul\" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.", "completion": "Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?"}
{"prompt": "It's in the stars.", "completion": "No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means."}
{"prompt": "Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.", "completion": "Is that your professional opinion?"}
{"prompt": "So what do you think it was?", "completion": "Why would anyone make up a thing like that?"}
{"prompt": "Barrett.  Dana Barrett.", "completion": "... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there."}
{"prompt": "Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.", "completion": "We're all professionals here, Miss ..."}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?"}
{"prompt": "But why?  The students love us!", "completion": "Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of \"dodge\" or \"hustle.\"  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University."}
{"prompt": "This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.", "completion": "Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities."}
{"prompt": "I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.", "completion": "No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately."}
{"prompt": "I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.", "completion": "That would definitely explain it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.", "completion": "You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street."}
{"prompt": "Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.", "completion": "Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me."}
{"prompt": "That is one speedy mutt.", "completion": "He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed."}
{"prompt": "Did you see it?  What was it?", "completion": "We'll get back to you."}
{"prompt": "What's that got to do with it?", "completion": "Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!"}
{"prompt": "Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.", "completion": "One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet."}
{"prompt": "Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?", "completion": "Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz."}
{"prompt": "Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.", "completion": "I don't believe in luck."}
{"prompt": "I want you to have this.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.", "completion": "That's so romantic."}
{"prompt": "Die in what sense?", "completion": "In the physical sense."}
{"prompt": "Remind me not to go to lunch with you.", "completion": "Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die."}
{"prompt": "Oh, that's very - unusual.", "completion": "I think it's the food of the future."}
{"prompt": "It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?", "completion": "I collect spores, molds and fungus."}
{"prompt": "That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?", "completion": "Is that a game?"}
{"prompt": "You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.", "completion": "Print is dead."}
{"prompt": "Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.", "completion": "Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me."}
{"prompt": "The EPA?  What's he want?", "completion": "I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help."}
{"prompt": "Here are tonight's calls.", "completion": "And someone from the EPA is here to see you."}
{"prompt": "What calls?", "completion": "Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.", "completion": "Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine."}
{"prompt": "Did you ever report it to anyone?", "completion": "Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight."}
{"prompt": "Has this ever happened before?", "completion": "Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though."}
{"prompt": "... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.", "completion": "Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...", "completion": "That's \"Peck!\""}
{"prompt": "The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.", "completion": "Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ..."}
{"prompt": "You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.", "completion": "See!  They are using drugs."}
{"prompt": "At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.", "completion": "Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass."}
{"prompt": "Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.", "completion": "Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!"}
{"prompt": "Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.", "completion": "Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution."}
{"prompt": "May I please see the storage facility?", "completion": "Why do you want to see it?"}
{"prompt": "And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?", "completion": "The magic word is \"please.\""}
{"prompt": "And why not, Mr. Venkman?", "completion": "Because you didn't say the magic word."}
{"prompt": "And may I see this storage facility?", "completion": "No, you may not."}
{"prompt": "And would this storage facility be located on these premises?", "completion": "Yes, it would."}
{"prompt": "And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?", "completion": "In a storage facility."}
{"prompt": "And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?", "completion": "I'm not at liberty to say."}
{"prompt": "I see.  And now you catch ghosts?", "completion": "You could say that."}
{"prompt": "Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?", "completion": "I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology."}
{"prompt": "Are you Peter Venkman?", "completion": "Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman."}
{"prompt": "I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.", "completion": "Great!  How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "Then my theory was correct.", "completion": "Can I help you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.", "completion": "I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!"}
{"prompt": "You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?", "completion": "Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry.  This isn't your day.", "completion": "Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this."}
{"prompt": "Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?", "completion": "Two wavy lines?"}
{"prompt": "Nervous?", "completion": "Yes.  I don't like this."}
{"prompt": "Circle?", "completion": "Close -- but definitely wrong."}
{"prompt": "A square?", "completion": "Good guess -- but no."}
{"prompt": "Wow!", "completion": "All right.  What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?", "completion": "On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.", "completion": "I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?", "completion": "They're not guns.  They're particle throwers."}
{"prompt": "You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?", "completion": "When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?"}
{"prompt": "What on earth gave you that idea?", "completion": "The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ..."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Were you recently in the bathroom?"}
{"prompt": "Life is just a state of mind.", "completion": "But it's my favorite state."}
{"prompt": "No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.", "completion": "No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!"}
{"prompt": "Full-stream with strogon pulse.", "completion": "On the count of three!  One ... Two ..."}
{"prompt": "Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.", "completion": "What now?"}
{"prompt": "Gozer.", "completion": "You talked to Gozer?"}
{"prompt": "She said he was \"the Destructor.\"", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.", "completion": "Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world."}
{"prompt": "Oh, shit!", "completion": "Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920."}
{"prompt": "If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.", "completion": "Where's the Keymaster?"}
{"prompt": "All right, Peter.  Good night.", "completion": "He wants to shut down the storage grid."}
{"prompt": "All right.  I'll try.", "completion": "I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning."}
{"prompt": "I agree.", "completion": "You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous."}
{"prompt": "Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?", "completion": "Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point."}
{"prompt": "Does she want to be?", "completion": "I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed."}
{"prompt": "It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.", "completion": "It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem."}
{"prompt": "Trust me.  It will be bad.", "completion": "What do you mean \"bad?\""}
{"prompt": "Don't cross the beams.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Something was definitely here.", "completion": "Yeah, I can smell it."}
{"prompt": "Did you see anything?", "completion": "Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping."}
{"prompt": "Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?", "completion": "She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is."}
{"prompt": "Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.", "completion": "Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams."}
{"prompt": "I'm always serious.", "completion": "Wow!"}
{"prompt": "Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?", "completion": "Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?"}
{"prompt": "What have you got, Egon?", "completion": "Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here."}
{"prompt": "That appears to be the case.", "completion": "Oh!  You're here."}
{"prompt": "And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.", "completion": "You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?"}
{"prompt": "The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.", "completion": "Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies."}
{"prompt": "I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.", "completion": "What happened??!!!?"}
{"prompt": "I've got to sleep.", "completion": "I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?"}
{"prompt": "Set entry grid.", "completion": "Neutronize.  System shut."}
{"prompt": "It's working!", "completion": "Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now."}
{"prompt": "Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?", "completion": "God, it's ugly!"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, Buddy!", "completion": "We'd better adjust our streams."}
{"prompt": "I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.", "completion": "I blame myself."}
{"prompt": "You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.", "completion": "Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either."}
{"prompt": "The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!", "completion": "Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge."}
{"prompt": "Look!", "completion": "AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?"}
{"prompt": "I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!", "completion": "What?  What popped in there?"}
{"prompt": "Agile bastard, isn't he?", "completion": "Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!"}
{"prompt": "As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.", "completion": "Well, that ought to do it."}
{"prompt": "It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.", "completion": "I don't think it's Shandor."}
{"prompt": "Who was the architect?", "completion": "He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor."}
{"prompt": "I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?", "completion": "No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy."}
{"prompt": "Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?", "completion": "It's not good, Pete."}
{"prompt": "Boy, that was a rough one.", "completion": "I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me."}
{"prompt": "How do you know?", "completion": "I don't know.  I'm just guessing."}
{"prompt": "It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.", "completion": "Don't move.  It won't hurt you."}
{"prompt": "Sit tight.  I'm on my way.", "completion": "Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild."}
{"prompt": "Where are you, Pete?", "completion": "Third floor.  Get down here,"}
{"prompt": "All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.", "completion": "Ray -- Something's here."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.", "completion": "So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy."}
{"prompt": "No sense worrying about it now.", "completion": "Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem."}
{"prompt": "Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.", "completion": "So do I."}
{"prompt": "It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.", "completion": "They will."}
{"prompt": "Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?", "completion": "How was your date?"}
{"prompt": "Fourteen hundred.", "completion": "Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence."}
{"prompt": "Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?", "completion": "Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?"}
{"prompt": "Wow!  Does this pole still work?", "completion": "This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of \"pricey\" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company."}
{"prompt": "But most people are afraid to even report these things.", "completion": "Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before."}
{"prompt": "You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.", "completion": "But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy."}
{"prompt": "You'll never regret this, Ray.", "completion": "My parents left me that house, I was born there."}
{"prompt": "For what purpose?", "completion": "To go into business for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.", "completion": "Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there."}
{"prompt": "This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.", "completion": "You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress."}
{"prompt": "You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.", "completion": "Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too."}
{"prompt": "If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.", "completion": "Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.", "completion": "If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize."}
{"prompt": "\"Get her?\"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?", "completion": "I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.", "completion": "Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan."}
{"prompt": "What do I say?", "completion": "Anything!  Just make contact."}
{"prompt": "What do we do now?", "completion": "I don't know.  Talk to it."}
{"prompt": "It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.", "completion": "I told you it's real."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Looked at with your eyes.", "completion": "Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once."}
{"prompt": "Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?", "completion": "What do you mean by \"seen?\""}
{"prompt": "No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.", "completion": "Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big."}
{"prompt": "Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.", "completion": "Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean \"choose?\"  We don't understand.", "completion": "Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?"}
{"prompt": "LATER, MAN!!", "completion": "What's he talking about?  Choose what?"}
{"prompt": "Right.  We'll believe anything.", "completion": "Stantz?  You okay in there?"}
{"prompt": "Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?", "completion": "You don't have to worry about that with us, sir."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Judgement Day.", "completion": "Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world."}
{"prompt": "Right.  And the sky would fall ...", "completion": "Judgement Day ..."}
{"prompt": "Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?", "completion": "And the seas would boil ..."}
{"prompt": "Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.", "completion": "The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy."}
{"prompt": "Do you believe in God?", "completion": "No.  But I liked Jesus' style."}
{"prompt": "Me, too.", "completion": "Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325."}
{"prompt": "Are you a Christian, Ray?", "completion": "Mmmhmmm."}
{"prompt": "Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?", "completion": "Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual."}
{"prompt": "Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.", "completion": "Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do."}
{"prompt": "You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.", "completion": "What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion."}
{"prompt": "Do you want posters, too?", "completion": "Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that."}
{"prompt": "Send them out!", "completion": "Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action..."}
{"prompt": "I am their hero!", "completion": "Not yet, dear brother..."}
{"prompt": "I want that bastard dead!", "completion": "You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero."}
{"prompt": "Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.", "completion": "You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd."}
{"prompt": "Yes?  Go on!", "completion": "\"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?\""}
{"prompt": "But I get what I want, always, don't I?", "completion": "\"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast...\""}
{"prompt": "Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.", "completion": "If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want."}
{"prompt": "Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.", "completion": "What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "What is that... wailing?", "completion": "The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying."}
{"prompt": "You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.", "completion": "Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet."}
{"prompt": "Where have you been?", "completion": "Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?"}
{"prompt": "You're coming back?", "completion": "I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?"}
{"prompt": "You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.", "completion": "Tribuus... tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Why not do it in the Colosseum?", "completion": "Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard."}
{"prompt": "If I may be so bold...", "completion": "For the gods, spit it out!"}
{"prompt": "Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.", "completion": "How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate."}
{"prompt": "I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!", "completion": "It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight."}
{"prompt": "Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.", "completion": "Those are priceless sculptures."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure, I don't know.", "completion": "No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him."}
{"prompt": "If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.", "completion": "Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.", "completion": "I should at least have you, don't you think?"}
{"prompt": "Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?", "completion": "They hate me, they really hate me don't they?"}
{"prompt": "And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!", "completion": "Don't you think you should at least wave?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.", "completion": "Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome..."}
{"prompt": "More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.", "completion": "I was suddenly thinking about going to bed."}
{"prompt": "Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?", "completion": "I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon."}
{"prompt": "We're nearly there, Lucilla.", "completion": "That's what you told me two days ago!"}
{"prompt": "If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.", "completion": "Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!"}
{"prompt": "On what charge?", "completion": "Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?"}
{"prompt": "And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.", "completion": "The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried..."}
{"prompt": "Where is my family?", "completion": "Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you."}
{"prompt": "They won't break this one.", "completion": "Apparently my opinion wasn't needed."}
{"prompt": "We have to stop the Germans now!", "completion": "Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!"}
{"prompt": "That this illness has clouded his mind.", "completion": "I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube."}
{"prompt": "Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.", "completion": "Caesar?"}
{"prompt": "You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.", "completion": "You flatter me, Caesar."}
{"prompt": "But they're not destroyed, not yet.", "completion": "Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position."}
{"prompt": "I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.", "completion": "The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care."}
{"prompt": "I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...", "completion": "Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?"}
{"prompt": "Gladly Caesar.", "completion": "Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions..."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.", "completion": "Then you'd be out of a job."}
{"prompt": "Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?", "completion": "That's difficult to say, general."}
{"prompt": "Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.", "completion": "Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't know who to bet on.", "completion": "Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather."}
{"prompt": "Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.", "completion": "Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena."}
{"prompt": "Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.", "completion": "Take grain away from the army?"}
{"prompt": "We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.", "completion": "Give away food?"}
{"prompt": "I'm serious.", "completion": "So am I."}
{"prompt": "Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.", "completion": "Maybe it'll crush Gaius."}
{"prompt": "At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...", "completion": "Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!"}
{"prompt": "Until your confirmation date.", "completion": "And like children everywhere they scream \"freedom\" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar."}
{"prompt": "At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...", "completion": "Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?"}
{"prompt": "Caesar, ignore them.", "completion": "Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better."}
{"prompt": "The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.", "completion": "How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir..."}
{"prompt": "Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.", "completion": "Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name."}
{"prompt": "Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.", "completion": "You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it."}
{"prompt": "Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.", "completion": "It's because he comes off as the underdog."}
{"prompt": "I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.", "completion": "This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power."}
{"prompt": "He left us at dawn.", "completion": "We must obey our emperor and the Senate."}
{"prompt": "I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.", "completion": "Marcus Aurelius has died."}
{"prompt": "We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...", "completion": "Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light."}
{"prompt": "Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.", "completion": "Yes, Caesar."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Caesar?", "completion": "Jerses -- tomorrow..."}
{"prompt": "Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!", "completion": "Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control..."}
{"prompt": "Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?", "completion": "He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed."}
{"prompt": "Where is my father?", "completion": "Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?"}
{"prompt": "I'll nose around...", "completion": "You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing..."}
{"prompt": "I don't know...", "completion": "AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime."}
{"prompt": "Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?", "completion": "Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!"}
{"prompt": "I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?", "completion": "\"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens.\"  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition."}
{"prompt": "You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...", "completion": "This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you..."}
{"prompt": "It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?", "completion": "Yes, because I know they'll read it."}
{"prompt": "That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?", "completion": "Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?"}
{"prompt": "The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!", "completion": "The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know."}
{"prompt": "I am prepared to write anything you tell me.", "completion": "My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus."}
{"prompt": "So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...", "completion": "That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action."}
{"prompt": "But have never been?", "completion": "My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all."}
{"prompt": "You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.", "completion": "I've read of it."}
{"prompt": "God of passages and changes?", "completion": "I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius."}
{"prompt": "I hope you live to see what I believe...", "completion": "The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors."}
{"prompt": "The Senate too?", "completion": "The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed."}
{"prompt": "The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.", "completion": "We all know what right is, Senator."}
{"prompt": "Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?", "completion": "A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right."}
{"prompt": "You don't know how wrong you are.", "completion": "I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire."}
{"prompt": "I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?", "completion": "You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator."}
{"prompt": "When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.", "completion": "Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word."}
{"prompt": "You're hearing about somebody else.", "completion": "How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?"}
{"prompt": "They can't... if this is Rome...", "completion": "Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are."}
{"prompt": "That's what worries me...", "completion": "Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?"}
{"prompt": "My loyalties... were in doubt.", "completion": "Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial."}
{"prompt": "You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?", "completion": "Why you?"}
{"prompt": "Where are they?", "completion": "Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe."}
{"prompt": "He killed his father and then my family...", "completion": "Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them."}
{"prompt": "Would that Marcus had lived.", "completion": "Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son."}
{"prompt": "\"But what if I wish to be purple?\"", "completion": "You cannot die."}
{"prompt": "Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?", "completion": "\"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But...\""}
{"prompt": "For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.", "completion": "To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters."}
{"prompt": "But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.", "completion": "Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!"}
{"prompt": "I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.", "completion": "You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist."}
{"prompt": "It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.", "completion": "Yours will do!"}
{"prompt": "I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.", "completion": "Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful."}
{"prompt": "Why do you play at being drunk?", "completion": "How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.", "completion": "Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing."}
{"prompt": "Sneaking around with your brother?", "completion": "Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting."}
{"prompt": "Only from a distance.", "completion": "I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities."}
{"prompt": "Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.", "completion": "You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?"}
{"prompt": "I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.", "completion": "No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day."}
{"prompt": "They fear me.", "completion": "They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic."}
{"prompt": "Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.", "completion": "The Senators admire you."}
{"prompt": "You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...", "completion": "A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir."}
{"prompt": "So I understand.", "completion": "Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?"}
{"prompt": "Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.", "completion": "It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate."}
{"prompt": "He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.", "completion": "If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!"}
{"prompt": "There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.", "completion": "Servis made it through again?"}
{"prompt": "I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.", "completion": "I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over."}
{"prompt": "Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!", "completion": "I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign."}
{"prompt": "Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.", "completion": "The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable."}
{"prompt": "On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?", "completion": "On my honor as your daddy..."}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow?", "completion": "As soon as I can."}
{"prompt": "Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.", "completion": "Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can."}
{"prompt": "Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?", "completion": "I made the plume from a quail feather."}
{"prompt": "The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!", "completion": "What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!"}
{"prompt": "You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!", "completion": "Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators..."}
{"prompt": "It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.", "completion": "Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!"}
{"prompt": "I was summoned.", "completion": "It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons."}
{"prompt": "I can't let you do that.", "completion": "You brought the army into Rome."}
{"prompt": "Well, they die for it!", "completion": "On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort."}
{"prompt": "Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?", "completion": "My troops don't make policy."}
{"prompt": "What deal?", "completion": "Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis."}
{"prompt": "Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.", "completion": "Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal."}
{"prompt": "Well, we can try...", "completion": "Serious stuff..."}
{"prompt": "What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.", "completion": "Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation."}
{"prompt": "Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.", "completion": "What the hell was all that about?"}
{"prompt": "That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...", "completion": "I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army."}
{"prompt": "They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!", "completion": "You teach them!"}
{"prompt": "I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.", "completion": "Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!"}
{"prompt": "Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.", "completion": "I don't want you to die!"}
{"prompt": "How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...", "completion": "Narcissus!"}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "You're not going!  You have to stay with us!"}
{"prompt": "What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.", "completion": "When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia."}
{"prompt": "Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.", "completion": "I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen..."}
{"prompt": "Quintus is overly idealistic.", "completion": "I never knew a more idealistic man than you."}
{"prompt": "I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.", "completion": "Let him trust Quintus."}
{"prompt": "I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?", "completion": "We don't need your help we're doing great on our own."}
{"prompt": "Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?", "completion": "Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!"}
{"prompt": "This is our oil from our estates?", "completion": "I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become."}
{"prompt": "The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!", "completion": "If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines."}
{"prompt": "You need to come home!", "completion": "I can see that..."}
{"prompt": "They're studying with Cynics.", "completion": "Of course..."}
{"prompt": "Athenians...", "completion": "What about their philosophy lessons?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.", "completion": "Greeks?"}
{"prompt": "He's very realistic.", "completion": "Isn't the helmet magnificent?"}
{"prompt": "Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.", "completion": "Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business."}
{"prompt": "I want nothing to do with the arena.", "completion": "Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?"}
{"prompt": "Was I?", "completion": "Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak."}
{"prompt": "So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.", "completion": "You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?"}
{"prompt": "I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.", "completion": "I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!"}
{"prompt": "Before they leave, get gold.", "completion": "Right, right, what am I thinking of?"}
{"prompt": "Then get a large cash advance.", "completion": "Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this."}
{"prompt": "No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.", "completion": "Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive."}
{"prompt": "They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...", "completion": "I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?"}
{"prompt": "How much money is involved?", "completion": "A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot..."}
{"prompt": "Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.", "completion": "Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!"}
{"prompt": "Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?", "completion": "On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!"}
{"prompt": "Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?", "completion": "It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!"}
{"prompt": "Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.", "completion": "But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!"}
{"prompt": "As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'", "completion": "The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!"}
{"prompt": "So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?", "completion": "You get to come alive again in the country!"}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you talking about, Greek?", "completion": "You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!"}
{"prompt": "Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...", "completion": "Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall."}
{"prompt": "Lucky it didn't step on his head.", "completion": "No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!"}
{"prompt": "Don't be ridiculous.", "completion": "It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant."}
{"prompt": "Alive... I'm alive...", "completion": "Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin."}
{"prompt": "Think about it!  Just think about it!", "completion": "General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you."}
{"prompt": "At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...", "completion": "What would the poster say: \"Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?\""}
{"prompt": "I didn't get killed and everyone else did.", "completion": "That's one way to look at it."}
{"prompt": "Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...", "completion": "General, do you realize what happened out there today?"}
{"prompt": "Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!", "completion": "I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight."}
{"prompt": "I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --", "completion": "-- to fight?  We'll see..."}
{"prompt": "Chain him.", "completion": "Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise."}
{"prompt": "Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.", "completion": "Take your hands off me animal!"}
{"prompt": "You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.", "completion": "Death is a very light thing for you."}
{"prompt": "Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!", "completion": "Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?"}
{"prompt": "Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?", "completion": "General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen."}
{"prompt": "Who the hell are you?", "completion": "I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons."}
{"prompt": "I killed too many barbarians.", "completion": "I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.", "completion": "Benjamin?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "The day after tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "Where did he do it?", "completion": "Are we getting married tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no. He said that.", "completion": "Shhhh."}
{"prompt": "Well, what did he say? I'm curious.", "completion": "He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team."}
{"prompt": "How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.", "completion": "No, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Why do you have to see him?", "completion": "Well -- I said I might marry him."}
{"prompt": "Who -- that guy at the Zoo?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Carl who?", "completion": "Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years."}
{"prompt": "Well -- I have to see Carl first.", "completion": "Carl who?"}
{"prompt": "Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?", "completion": "Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests."}
{"prompt": "Why wouldn't it?", "completion": "I just don't think it would..."}
{"prompt": "I just don't think it would work.", "completion": "Why wouldn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.", "completion": "We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?"}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow?", "completion": "Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "I'll think about it.", "completion": "You really will?"}
{"prompt": "I have to go back now.", "completion": "Elaine -- are you serious about this?"}
{"prompt": "I don't see how we can.", "completion": "We just can."}
{"prompt": "You mean you're confused?", "completion": "Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married."}
{"prompt": "How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --", "completion": "I don't know. I don't know what's happening."}
{"prompt": "When?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Is that so? You might marry me?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "But you might.", "completion": "I might."}
{"prompt": "You won't?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Will you kiss me!"}
{"prompt": "Goodbye.", "completion": "Benjamin?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.", "completion": "But Elaine --"}
{"prompt": "I don't want you to leave tomorrow.", "completion": "I don't understand."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Well -- where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Are you going home?"}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "What are you going to do now?"}
{"prompt": "The marble?", "completion": "The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother."}
{"prompt": "Don't you have it on?", "completion": "No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother."}
{"prompt": "What are you looking for?", "completion": "My belt."}
{"prompt": "Can I just sit here while you're packing?", "completion": "If you want."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?", "completion": "Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin -- this is my mother!", "completion": "-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --"}
{"prompt": "Don't tell me --", "completion": "-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --"}
{"prompt": "Please let me go.", "completion": "All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --"}
{"prompt": "Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.", "completion": "Elaine -- that is not what happened."}
{"prompt": "She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.", "completion": "Then what?"}
{"prompt": "Because it isn't true.", "completion": "I don't feel well."}
{"prompt": "You've got to tell me what she said.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "What did she say?", "completion": "Let me go."}
{"prompt": "Did you say rape her?", "completion": "-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I don't understand --"}
{"prompt": "How could you do that, Benjamin?", "completion": "Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my..."}
{"prompt": "Well, I want you to leave.", "completion": "Elaine -- I love you."}
{"prompt": "I said I think it is.", "completion": "All right then! Yes!"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "I think it is."}
{"prompt": "Because -- I am.", "completion": "Is it because I'm here?"}
{"prompt": "Come in.", "completion": "No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?"}
{"prompt": "I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.", "completion": "I want to ask you a question."}
{"prompt": "Here he comes.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.", "completion": "-- really incredible --"}
{"prompt": "No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.", "completion": "Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --"}
{"prompt": "Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --", "completion": "But you're not enrolled."}
{"prompt": "Here? In Berkeley?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here."}
{"prompt": "Where did he say he was going to meet you?", "completion": "I thought he said by the monkey house."}
{"prompt": "Is that him over there?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I've never been to it.", "completion": "Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you."}
{"prompt": "At the Zoo.", "completion": "The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?"}
{"prompt": "Ah. Where?", "completion": "Where are you meeting this person?"}
{"prompt": "Get out of here.", "completion": "I'm meeting someone."}
{"prompt": "GET OUT!", "completion": "Don't cry."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God --", "completion": "No -- don't cry --"}
{"prompt": "Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --", "completion": "Elaine --"}
{"prompt": "That woman. The older woman.", "completion": "You mean the one who --"}
{"prompt": "That woman --", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Because I want to know what's happening.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Hurry up. Put your shoes on.", "completion": "Why aren't you ready?"}
{"prompt": "You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.", "completion": "Benjamin -- what's happening?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin -- I really do.", "completion": "What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "I do.", "completion": "You do?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "You sure you really want to?"}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "During the day? We'll go for a drive or something."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I'm glad."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "And it's all over now."}
{"prompt": "Yes. She had a husband and a son.", "completion": "Did they ever find out?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "With a family?"}
{"prompt": "It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?", "completion": "Was she married or something?"}
{"prompt": "You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.", "completion": "I'm sorry. That is not my business."}
{"prompt": "Do you?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?", "completion": "I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin -- do they know you?", "completion": "Of course not."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin --", "completion": "Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.", "completion": "Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there."}
{"prompt": "What is the matter?", "completion": "Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.", "completion": "Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?"}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "Where we going?"}
{"prompt": "Is anything wrong?", "completion": "No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "We won't. Let's go inside.", "completion": "Wait a minute."}
{"prompt": "Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.", "completion": "No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up."}
{"prompt": "I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?", "completion": "Yes, I do."}
{"prompt": "But could you try?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Listen -- could you stop crying, please?", "completion": "No, I couldn't."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.", "completion": "No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it."}
{"prompt": "I want to go home.", "completion": "But could I just tell you this one thing?"}
{"prompt": "Where is the car?", "completion": "I just want to tell you something."}
{"prompt": "I think I'd better go home now please.", "completion": "But, Elaine --"}
{"prompt": "Will you take me home now?", "completion": "I'm sorry I took you in there."}
{"prompt": "Could you do it?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "No -- why should I?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.", "completion": "Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "I'd love some.", "completion": "Aren't you eating?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Do you want some dinner?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Do you always drive like this?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Are you going to graduate school?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Do you know what you're going to do?"}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "You're living at home now. Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "I certainly hope you --", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --", "completion": "Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?"}
{"prompt": "This is Dr. Smith's answering service.", "completion": "Is the doctor anywhere?"}
{"prompt": "657-2036", "completion": "Hello -- who is this?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I will.", "completion": "Okay. Enough said. That's a deal."}
{"prompt": "Exactly how do you mean?", "completion": "There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes I am.", "completion": "Plastics."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Are you listening?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. McQuire.", "completion": "Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.", "completion": "Ben."}
{"prompt": "Get out!", "completion": "Ben!"}
{"prompt": "I am going to call the police now.", "completion": "Could I make one phone call first?"}
{"prompt": "I want you out of here.", "completion": "Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?"}
{"prompt": "Because I don't like you.", "completion": "Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?"}
{"prompt": "You heard me. Out of here.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "No, sir.", "completion": "Mr. McCleery?"}
{"prompt": "See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.", "completion": "All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?"}
{"prompt": "What did you do to her?", "completion": "Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now."}
{"prompt": "Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.", "completion": "It was just a visitor. But it's all right now."}
{"prompt": "Who screamed?", "completion": "It's all right, Mr. McCleery."}
{"prompt": "I hate that. I won't stand for it.", "completion": "Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery."}
{"prompt": "One of those outside agitators.", "completion": "Oh -- no sir."}
{"prompt": "You're not one of those agitators?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.", "completion": "Ahhh."}
{"prompt": "What are you then?", "completion": "Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through."}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "I said -- not exactly -- no."}
{"prompt": "You a student?", "completion": "Not exactly."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I'll be there in an hour."}
{"prompt": "No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --", "completion": "Give me an hour."}
{"prompt": "Uh -- The Taft Hotel.", "completion": "Did you get a room?"}
{"prompt": "-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --", "completion": "Where are you?"}
{"prompt": "Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --", "completion": "Where are you?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --", "completion": "Benjamin?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "I'd rather not.", "completion": "All right. Put it in the room where we were."}
{"prompt": "I'm putting it here by the door.", "completion": "Will you bring it in to me?"}
{"prompt": "I'm putting it on the top step.", "completion": "For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?"}
{"prompt": "Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.", "completion": "Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what."}
{"prompt": "Could you bring it up?", "completion": "Well I'll hand it to you."}
{"prompt": "I'm in the bathroom.", "completion": "Well here's the purse."}
{"prompt": "I have to go now. I'm sorry.", "completion": "Mrs. Robinson?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Will you bring up my purse before you go?"}
{"prompt": "Whatever you say, sir.", "completion": "BENJAMIN?"}
{"prompt": "I'll have a porter show you the room.", "completion": "Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself."}
{"prompt": "I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Oh no.", "completion": "Sir?"}
{"prompt": "Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.", "completion": "Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Where is your luggage?"}
{"prompt": "Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.", "completion": "Where is it?"}
{"prompt": "What? No. Nothing.", "completion": "Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?"}
{"prompt": "Will you sign the register, please?", "completion": "Is anything wrong, sir?"}
{"prompt": "A single room or a double room?", "completion": "A single. Just for myself, please."}
{"prompt": "Yes sir?", "completion": "A room. I'd like a room, please."}
{"prompt": "It's in the main ballroom.", "completion": "Ahh -- thank you."}
{"prompt": "The Singleman party, sir?", "completion": "Oh -- yes. The Singleman party."}
{"prompt": "What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think so.", "completion": "Can I help you, sir!"}
{"prompt": "Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.", "completion": "I'll find her."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --", "completion": "What the hell have you done?"}
{"prompt": "I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?", "completion": "You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her."}
{"prompt": "I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.", "completion": "What have you done to her?"}
{"prompt": "Hello. Get me the police, please.", "completion": "Where is Elaine?"}
{"prompt": "Go home now.", "completion": "I just don't believe you would do that."}
{"prompt": "Then you'd better start believing me.", "completion": "Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it."}
{"prompt": "In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.", "completion": "I don't believe you."}
{"prompt": "I can makes things quite unpleasant.", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?", "completion": "Mrs. Robinson --"}
{"prompt": "Do exactly what I say.", "completion": "Now it seems to me --"}
{"prompt": "Drive down the block.", "completion": "Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive."}
{"prompt": "Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.", "completion": "But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.", "completion": "Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  Benjamin --", "completion": "Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all."}
{"prompt": "Promise me, Benjamin.", "completion": "All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson."}
{"prompt": "Then give me your word you won't.", "completion": "This is absurd."}
{"prompt": "Well don't thank me, because I want you to.", "completion": "Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Please. I want you to.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.", "completion": "May I stay then?"}
{"prompt": "It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.", "completion": "You don't have to say that."}
{"prompt": "Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.", "completion": "But if it's sickening for you --"}
{"prompt": "But it's not.", "completion": "That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you."}
{"prompt": "Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.", "completion": "If that's how you feel --"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more."}
{"prompt": "You wouldn't.", "completion": "Of course I wouldn't."}
{"prompt": "Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.", "completion": "I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is."}
{"prompt": "Of course you did.", "completion": "Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.", "completion": "Did I say that?"}
{"prompt": "Don't start acting hurt.", "completion": "Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?"}
{"prompt": "Now don't start this.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You're goddamn right I am.", "completion": "That I'm a sick and disgusting person."}
{"prompt": "Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.", "completion": "Are you?"}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong."}
{"prompt": "You're not.", "completion": "No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!"}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't know.", "completion": "Well, I'm not."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin?", "completion": "I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?"}
{"prompt": "Let's drop it.", "completion": "We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --"}
{"prompt": "Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.", "completion": "I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?"}
{"prompt": "Then let's hear them.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "But why shouldn't I?", "completion": "I have my reasons."}
{"prompt": "I was just kidding around.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.", "completion": "Do you understand that?"}
{"prompt": "Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?", "completion": "Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --"}
{"prompt": "I wish you'd tell me.", "completion": "There's nothing to tell."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Because I don't want you to."}
{"prompt": "Don't talk about Elaine?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.", "completion": "Don't talk about Elaine."}
{"prompt": "A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!", "completion": "That's enough."}
{"prompt": "Really. I want to know.", "completion": "It was a Ford, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Do you remember the make of the car?", "completion": "Oh my God."}
{"prompt": "What kind of car was it?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no. In the car you did it?", "completion": "I don't think we were the first."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious.", "completion": "We'd go to his car."}
{"prompt": "I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?", "completion": "Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?"}
{"prompt": "Well how did it happen?", "completion": "How do you think."}
{"prompt": "But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.", "completion": "Kind of."}
{"prompt": "Art.", "completion": "Art?"}
{"prompt": "Why are you asking me all this?", "completion": "Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "What was your major?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "At college."}
{"prompt": "Was he a law student at the time?", "completion": "And you were a student also."}
{"prompt": "I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?", "completion": "Not particularly."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...", "completion": "All right. Now let's get to bed."}
{"prompt": "Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?", "completion": "Are you shocked?"}
{"prompt": "I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?", "completion": "Don't tell Elaine."}
{"prompt": "Well I can't.", "completion": "Think real hard, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Why did you do that?", "completion": "See if you can guess."}
{"prompt": "I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --", "completion": "Well, wait a minute. You married him."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.", "completion": "Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him."}
{"prompt": "Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?", "completion": "Is it?"}
{"prompt": "Well how do you feel about him, then?", "completion": "I don't."}
{"prompt": "But you don't hate him.", "completion": "No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.", "completion": "Not exactly."}
{"prompt": "So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --", "completion": "We've talked enough, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Man, is this interesting.", "completion": "Is it?"}
{"prompt": "How many times a year.", "completion": "On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday."}
{"prompt": "You have not slept with your husband for five years?", "completion": "Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year."}
{"prompt": "Oh no. Are you kidding me?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Well how long has this been going on.", "completion": "About five years."}
{"prompt": "So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.", "completion": "No we don't."}
{"prompt": "Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.", "completion": "We don't."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Now let's keep going here.", "completion": "Can I undress and talk at the same time?"}
{"prompt": "We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.", "completion": "Calm down, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "We're talking.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "But what about the noise from the car. What if --", "completion": "The driveway's on my side of the house."}
{"prompt": "Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.", "completion": "Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock."}
{"prompt": "Always?", "completion": "Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic."}
{"prompt": "What do you say to him?", "completion": "He's asleep."}
{"prompt": "I walk out.", "completion": "You walk right out the door."}
{"prompt": "There's no risk?", "completion": "How do you get out of the house?"}
{"prompt": "I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.", "completion": "There isn't any."}
{"prompt": "Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.", "completion": "Him?"}
{"prompt": "There!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I don't remember.", "completion": "Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What novel did you read."}
{"prompt": "I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.", "completion": "What one."}
{"prompt": "Do you want to hear it or not?", "completion": "Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality."}
{"prompt": "Yes I do.", "completion": "I got up."}
{"prompt": "No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.", "completion": "Do you really want me to?"}
{"prompt": "I don't.", "completion": "Can I take off my clothes now?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Then why do you want to talk about it?"}
{"prompt": "Neither.", "completion": "You're not interested in art?"}
{"prompt": "Art. Well what do you want to know about it.", "completion": "Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art."}
{"prompt": "Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.", "completion": "Go ahead then."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.", "completion": "You start it off. I don't know anything about it."}
{"prompt": "Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.", "completion": "How about art."}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --"}
{"prompt": "Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?", "completion": "Oh my God."}
{"prompt": "Well what do you want to talk about?", "completion": "Anything. Anything at all."}
{"prompt": "Are you tired of it?", "completion": "I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?"}
{"prompt": "Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.", "completion": "All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together."}
{"prompt": "If you want.", "completion": "Good. I mean are we dead or something?"}
{"prompt": "INADEQUATE!", "completion": "Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute.", "completion": "-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --"}
{"prompt": "Who said it was my first time?", "completion": "That you're afraid --"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute!", "completion": "On your first time --"}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding?", "completion": "It's nothing to be ashamed of --"}
{"prompt": "That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.", "completion": "You can admit that, can't you?"}
{"prompt": "Is this -- what?", "completion": "It is, isn't it? It is your first time."}
{"prompt": "No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.", "completion": "Benjamin, is this your first time?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --", "completion": "Are you afraid of me?"}
{"prompt": "This is all terribly wrong.", "completion": "Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.", "completion": "You what?"}
{"prompt": "You're welcome.", "completion": "Would this be easier for you in the dark?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Wood or wire? They have both.", "completion": "Either one will be fine."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- yes. Wood?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "A hanger."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- sure. Thank you.", "completion": "Will you bring me a hanger?"}
{"prompt": "Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.", "completion": "Why don't you watch?"}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?"}
{"prompt": "Well.", "completion": "Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson."}
{"prompt": "The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.", "completion": "Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512."}
{"prompt": "The number.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --"}
{"prompt": "Isn't there something you want to tell me?", "completion": "To tell you?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I'll be up in five minutes.", "completion": "Well -- goodbye then --"}
{"prompt": "Well -- do you want to go up first?", "completion": "Yes -- I think that would be good."}
{"prompt": "That's fine.", "completion": "But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --"}
{"prompt": "Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.", "completion": "I got a single room."}
{"prompt": "Well -- I don't know.", "completion": "Why don't you get it."}
{"prompt": "Now?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.", "completion": "Do you want to get it now?"}
{"prompt": "Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.", "completion": "Do you want me to get it?"}
{"prompt": "I haven't. No.", "completion": "Do you want to?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Have you gotten us a room yet?"}
{"prompt": "Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --", "completion": "Did you get us a room?"}
{"prompt": "Waiter!", "completion": "You don't have to be so nervous, you know."}
{"prompt": "A drink? Of course.", "completion": "He didn't see me."}
{"prompt": "Very well. Thank you.", "completion": "May I have a drink?"}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "How are you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. Hello. Hello.", "completion": "May I sit down?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you for taking me home.", "completion": "Hello, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin?", "completion": "Yes."}

{"prompt": "Yes. Yes. Let me out!", "completion": "Because I find you very attractive and any time --"}
{"prompt": "Let me out!", "completion": "Do you understand what I said?"}
{"prompt": "Oh my God.", "completion": "If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ!", "completion": "Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --"}
{"prompt": "Get away from that door.", "completion": "I want to say something first."}
{"prompt": "On that chair in the hall.", "completion": "Don't be nervous."}
{"prompt": "I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?", "completion": "Where is it?"}
{"prompt": "Is that what you're trying to tell me?", "completion": "I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now."}
{"prompt": "Would you like me to seduce you?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Why is it?", "completion": "Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --", "completion": "I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me."}
{"prompt": "I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --", "completion": "But they would! Don't you see?"}
{"prompt": "Don't you think he trusts us together?", "completion": "Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might."}
{"prompt": "What if he did?", "completion": "Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I have --", "completion": "But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?"}
{"prompt": "Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.", "completion": "Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.", "completion": "Then why do you keep running away?"}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "What are you so scared of?"}
{"prompt": "Come on.", "completion": "Thank you."}

{"prompt": "I think I'll go to bed.", "completion": "Oh. Well, goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Will you unzip my dress?"}
{"prompt": "I don't remember her as having brown eyes.", "completion": "Benjamin?"}

{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?", "completion": "Her portrait?"}
{"prompt": "We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.", "completion": "What is wrong with me?"}
{"prompt": "All right. Now finish your drink.", "completion": "Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you."}

{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.", "completion": "Aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.", "completion": "So?"}
{"prompt": "What do you think?", "completion": "Well I don't know."}
{"prompt": "I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.", "completion": "Like what?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.", "completion": "What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Oh my God.", "completion": "Pardon?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "My husband will be back quite late."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Look -- I think I should be going --", "completion": "Sit down, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Did you know that?"}
{"prompt": "Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.", "completion": "Did you know I was an alcoholic?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion."}
{"prompt": "I'm very neurotic.", "completion": "What do you think of me?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Are you always this much afraid of being alone?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Drink?"}
{"prompt": "Please wait till my husband gets home.", "completion": "When is he coming back?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "All right then.", "completion": "What do you drink?"}
{"prompt": "What do you drink? Bourbon?", "completion": "Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?"}
{"prompt": "But it's light in there now.", "completion": "Please."}
{"prompt": "Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.", "completion": "Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house."}
{"prompt": "I want you to come in till I get the lights on.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "Will you come in, please?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Let's go."}
{"prompt": "My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?", "completion": "You don't?"}
{"prompt": "Will you take me home?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin, I want to ask you something.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "In general.", "completion": "That's right."}
{"prompt": "Whatever it is you're upset about.", "completion": "Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things."}
{"prompt": "Is it a girl?", "completion": "Is what a girl?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke."}
{"prompt": "Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.", "completion": "Is there an ashtray in here?"}
{"prompt": "It's down the hall.", "completion": "How are you, Benjamin?"}
{"prompt": "Goodnight, sir.", "completion": "Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?"}
{"prompt": "Very good, sir.", "completion": "Yes. Well -- goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "The toothbrush. I got it all right."}
{"prompt": "Hey -- I don't get it.", "completion": "I say I've got it."}
{"prompt": "I'm afraid I don't understand.", "completion": "I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.", "completion": "No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend."}
{"prompt": "Braddock -- Braddock?", "completion": "Yes, but I'm afraid --"}
{"prompt": "No -- actually I'm not --", "completion": "I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --"}
{"prompt": "When did you two talk this over?", "completion": "We haven't."}
{"prompt": "Well -- when did you decide all this?", "completion": "About an hour ago."}
{"prompt": "They don't know?", "completion": "No -- they don't."}
{"prompt": "I'm going up to Berkeley today.", "completion": "Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --"}
{"prompt": "I do.", "completion": "-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday."}
{"prompt": "Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.", "completion": "Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --"}
{"prompt": "Goodnight.", "completion": "It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine."}
{"prompt": "You don't?", "completion": "But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me."}
{"prompt": "You believe me, don't you?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --", "completion": "Goodnight, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "I do.", "completion": "But I don't want you to make up something."}
{"prompt": "Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?", "completion": "Not if you don't want to."}
{"prompt": "Well why do you -- why do you think that?", "completion": "Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours."}
{"prompt": "Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.", "completion": "Well, wait."}
{"prompt": "No wait. Wait.", "completion": "I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?"}
{"prompt": "Why did you say that?", "completion": "Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --"}
{"prompt": "Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?", "completion": "Meet someone?"}
{"prompt": "Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.", "completion": "Oh, no."}
{"prompt": "What else?", "completion": "Nothing else."}
{"prompt": "No, I do. I want to tell you.", "completion": "I drive around."}
{"prompt": "When I go off?", "completion": "You don't have to tell me if you don't want."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Mrs. Robinson.", "completion": "Can I talk to you a minute?"}
{"prompt": "No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.", "completion": "Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin."}
{"prompt": "No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.", "completion": "Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked."}
{"prompt": "No. She doesn't know about it.", "completion": "She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?"}
{"prompt": "No. I think you'll want to wait on that.", "completion": "Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?"}
{"prompt": "I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.", "completion": "Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate."}
{"prompt": "I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --", "completion": "Say that again."}
{"prompt": "How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.", "completion": "That has nothing to do with it --"}
{"prompt": "I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?", "completion": "Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along."}
{"prompt": "You got me.", "completion": "Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?"}
{"prompt": "Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.", "completion": "Have you thought about graduate school?"}
{"prompt": "Different.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I want it to be --", "completion": "To be what?"}
{"prompt": "I guess -- about my future.", "completion": "What about it?"}
{"prompt": "Well --", "completion": "About what?"}
{"prompt": "I'm just --", "completion": "-- worried?"}
{"prompt": "HUH?", "completion": "I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure..."}
{"prompt": "The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.", "completion": "Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --"}
{"prompt": "You miss the point.", "completion": "Don't shout at me, Ben."}
{"prompt": "Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.", "completion": "Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?"}
{"prompt": "It shouldn't make any difference what happened.", "completion": "That's quite a statement."}
{"prompt": "But why?", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "No, I don't.", "completion": "Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon."}
{"prompt": "I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.", "completion": "You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?"}
{"prompt": "I am not threatening you.", "completion": "Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while."}
{"prompt": "Now look -- please --", "completion": "Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?"}
{"prompt": "It was nothing to do with you, sir.", "completion": "Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me."}
{"prompt": "No, it's not --", "completion": "Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Robinson?", "completion": "Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?"}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?"}
{"prompt": "I will.", "completion": "Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.", "completion": "That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time."}
{"prompt": "Great.", "completion": "Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?"}
{"prompt": "Ben -- I want you to give her a call.", "completion": "I will."}
{"prompt": "Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.", "completion": "Oh yes."}
{"prompt": "Oh no.", "completion": "What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?"}
{"prompt": "Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.", "completion": "You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man."}
{"prompt": "So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.", "completion": "I'd like to hear it."}
{"prompt": "In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "I've watched you grow up, Ben.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?", "completion": "Quite a while."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "How long have we known each other now?"}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "Ben, can I say something to you?"}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "You'll never be young again."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --"}
{"prompt": "Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.", "completion": "That's a hell of a good age to be."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much, sir.", "completion": "Ben -- how old are you now?"}
{"prompt": "Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.", "completion": "No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I've got to go."}
{"prompt": "Here. It looks like you need a refill.", "completion": "Oh no."}
{"prompt": "Standing guard over the old castle, are you?", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Swell. I appreciate it.", "completion": "She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I can.", "completion": "I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home."}
{"prompt": "Can you look through the glass.", "completion": "Can you see me now?"}
{"prompt": "Benjamin Braddock.", "completion": "Benjamin -- where are you?"}
{"prompt": "It's Benjamin.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Robinson?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.", "completion": "Dad -- can you listen --"}
{"prompt": "I'd like to discuss this.", "completion": "This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --"}
{"prompt": "Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --", "completion": "I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here."}
{"prompt": "Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?", "completion": "Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?"}
{"prompt": "That what he says. Right?", "completion": "Are you ready in there, feature attraction?"}
{"prompt": "Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.", "completion": "I don't believe it."}
{"prompt": "It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.", "completion": "What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "They are?  Come on.", "completion": "They came all the way from Tarzana."}
{"prompt": "No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!", "completion": "The Carlsons' are here."}
{"prompt": "Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --", "completion": "Is anything wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.", "completion": "It's a short life and a gay one..."}
{"prompt": "Splendid!", "completion": "Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life."}
{"prompt": "Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.", "completion": "I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --", "completion": "I'm having luck for the first time in my life."}
{"prompt": "If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --", "completion": "Turn 'em up."}
{"prompt": "I have an idea working in my head...", "completion": "You might find a bullet through that head..."}
{"prompt": "I'll pay you back.", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.", "completion": "What about the money?"}
{"prompt": "I've quit.", "completion": "You can't."}
{"prompt": "With the pearls?", "completion": "With the pearls --"}
{"prompt": "No --", "completion": "Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam..."}
{"prompt": "You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...", "completion": "I don't like your tone."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --"}
{"prompt": "Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...", "completion": "No -- no -- no -- no..."}
{"prompt": "I could take care of her.", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---"}
{"prompt": "Have you got that skeleton key?", "completion": "No --"}
{"prompt": "Need any help?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.", "completion": "I told you I'll get the pearls tonight."}
{"prompt": "Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.", "completion": "I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance."}
{"prompt": "And what are you going to do?", "completion": "The pearls are in her room."}
{"prompt": "She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.", "completion": "Well?"}
{"prompt": "Not now.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.", "completion": "I want to speak --"}
{"prompt": "No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.", "completion": "Time's getting short."}
{"prompt": "And Baron, thanks so much for everything.", "completion": "Have you a minute now?"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- oh!", "completion": "Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen."}
{"prompt": "For tonight.", "completion": "Oh!"}
{"prompt": "Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.", "completion": "You live here?"}
{"prompt": "Yes --", "completion": "Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night."}
{"prompt": "Anything for you.", "completion": "Going?"}
{"prompt": "Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.", "completion": "I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "You're not a bit like you were yesterday.", "completion": "I fell in love last night -- the real thing."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "I feel sorry for him."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- I'd love to.", "completion": "Then dance the next number with Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "I'll do anything for you.", "completion": "Would you like to make a man happy?"}
{"prompt": "That was lovely.", "completion": "Will you do me a big favor?"}
{"prompt": "You were very different yesterday.", "completion": "Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday."}
{"prompt": "Chasing what?", "completion": "Money."}
{"prompt": "Sorry.", "completion": "Chasing around."}
{"prompt": "All right. We'll dance.", "completion": "I'd given you up."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "We'll dance."}
{"prompt": "Yes? -- Tomorrow?", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "Yellow Room where they dance --", "completion": "You're very funny --"}
{"prompt": "Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?", "completion": "Where downstairs?"}
{"prompt": "Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.", "completion": "Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Free --"}
{"prompt": "Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --", "completion": "Aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Too bad.", "completion": "Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?", "completion": "Very little."}
{"prompt": "Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?", "completion": "Money -- Ever heard of it?"}
{"prompt": "Reducing?", "completion": "No -- why? -- should I?"}
{"prompt": "Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --", "completion": "Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it."}
{"prompt": "Oh!", "completion": "Dictation.  You know..."}
{"prompt": "You?", "completion": "Oh -- work!!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?", "completion": "That."}
{"prompt": "Whoever is keeping you waiting.", "completion": "Have you seen it?"}
{"prompt": "He must be very nice.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "You're a fool!", "completion": "Yes, I am rather."}
{"prompt": "Not with strangers.", "completion": "Never?"}
{"prompt": "Bless you --", "completion": "Like dancing?"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- I will be on the train.", "completion": "Till then."}

{"prompt": "Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.", "completion": "I can't."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.", "completion": "Bless you..."}
{"prompt": "I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.", "completion": "Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you."}
{"prompt": "Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.", "completion": "You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room."}
{"prompt": "Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?", "completion": "Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?"}
{"prompt": "I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.", "completion": "I'll give you what you need -- I have money."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- yes but -- later.", "completion": "Why later?"}
{"prompt": "For Vienna?", "completion": "Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both."}

{"prompt": "Grusinskaya --", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes -- yes -- yes."}
{"prompt": "And now?", "completion": "I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable."}
{"prompt": "But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---", "completion": "I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now."}
{"prompt": "So --", "completion": "Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --"}
{"prompt": "I'll not denounce you.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.", "completion": "I don't want them now."}
{"prompt": "There.", "completion": "Oh --"}
{"prompt": "Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.", "completion": "What is the matter?"}
{"prompt": "I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.", "completion": "That's a silly joke."}
{"prompt": "I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail", "completion": "Oh! What a picture -- and what else?"}
{"prompt": "And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.", "completion": "And what do you do -- now?"}
{"prompt": "When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---", "completion": "And?"}
{"prompt": "Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.", "completion": "No?"}

{"prompt": "I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.", "completion": "Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?"}
{"prompt": "That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.", "completion": "Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name."}
{"prompt": "The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.", "completion": "I want to be alone."}
{"prompt": "I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom."}
{"prompt": "What can you see?", "completion": "You are beautiful!"}
{"prompt": "Why do you smile?", "completion": "Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --"}
{"prompt": "I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?", "completion": "I should like to smoke."}
{"prompt": "The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?", "completion": "I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing."}
{"prompt": "No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.", "completion": "Just for a minute then."}
{"prompt": "That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.", "completion": "I want to be alone --"}
{"prompt": "I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?", "completion": "I want to be alone."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- I do understand.", "completion": "I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor."}
{"prompt": "I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...", "completion": "Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand."}
{"prompt": "A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.", "completion": "You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?"}
{"prompt": "I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.", "completion": "Go away. Who are you --?"}
{"prompt": "And...?", "completion": "He disappeared. Later he was found dead."}
{"prompt": "Am I quite strange to you?", "completion": "Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --"}
{"prompt": "You mustn't talk Russian to me.", "completion": "Strange man..."}
{"prompt": "So alone.", "completion": "Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature."}
{"prompt": "How tired you are!", "completion": "Yes -- tired..."}

{"prompt": "I did not know you were so beautiful... and --", "completion": "And then --?"}
{"prompt": "Certainly.", "completion": "Why do you look at me like that?"}
{"prompt": "So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?", "completion": "I'd like to smoke a cigarette."}
{"prompt": "Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?", "completion": "I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment."}
{"prompt": "I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.", "completion": "Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that."}
{"prompt": "Because you love me -- you love me?", "completion": "Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you hide in my room?", "completion": "But surely you must know -- because I love you."}
{"prompt": "What do you want here?", "completion": "Nothing -- only to be here."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.", "completion": "Please do not be frightened, Madam."}
{"prompt": "No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.", "completion": "You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.", "completion": "Goodnight, Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "All of that at once, Baron?", "completion": "Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.", "completion": "I take five hundred."}
{"prompt": "Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...", "completion": "Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance."}
{"prompt": "You've lost everything?", "completion": "I've no luck."}
{"prompt": "All right then.", "completion": "That was my last."}
{"prompt": "No -- not at all.", "completion": "All right then."}
{"prompt": "Ready, Baron.", "completion": "Is that too much, Baron?"}
{"prompt": "Good!", "completion": "Ready, Kringelein?"}
{"prompt": "If we could scare up some men to play.", "completion": "We could come to my room."}
{"prompt": "If I could get into a game I might win some.", "completion": "Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?"}
{"prompt": "Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.", "completion": "If the Baron -- if you would permit me --"}
{"prompt": "Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --", "completion": "Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?", "completion": "I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!"}
{"prompt": "The Baron is tired?", "completion": "No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --"}
{"prompt": "A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?", "completion": "No thanks -- keeping my head clear."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?", "completion": "A little strange, Baron."}
{"prompt": "Hello -- sorry I'm late.", "completion": "Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?"}
{"prompt": "In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?", "completion": "Where the music's playing and the ladies are..."}
{"prompt": "We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.", "completion": "I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room."}
{"prompt": "Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...", "completion": "Yes, quite."}
{"prompt": "Then you know him?", "completion": "Do I know him -- I know him through and through."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?", "completion": "General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --"}
{"prompt": "And this is Doctor Otternschlag.", "completion": "Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --"}
{"prompt": "I'm Baron von Gaigern.", "completion": "Oh, a Baron!"}
{"prompt": "Not at all, sir.", "completion": "Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf."}
{"prompt": "Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.", "completion": "Thank you, sir."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I was in the war.", "completion": "Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.", "completion": "The war dropped him here and forgot him."}
{"prompt": "The war.", "completion": "That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?"}
{"prompt": "My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.", "completion": "No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her."}
{"prompt": "It's always so quiet here.", "completion": "If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby."}
{"prompt": "I thought she was splendid!", "completion": "Yes -- but the audience."}
{"prompt": "Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.", "completion": "Well -- last night was not so good."}
{"prompt": "How's the beautiful lady?", "completion": "Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?"}
{"prompt": "Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.", "completion": "Oh -- good evening, Baron."}
{"prompt": "Don't do that.", "completion": "Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!", "completion": "Hello! Hello! --"}
{"prompt": "Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.", "completion": "Be quiet."}
{"prompt": "So that's how we stand, Baron.", "completion": "Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight."}
{"prompt": "I must have made a mistake.", "completion": "Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money."}
{"prompt": "As you will.", "completion": "Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?"}
{"prompt": "I think it would be much better if you went away.", "completion": "We shall see who remains here the longer."}
{"prompt": "Oh, let the poor devil alone.", "completion": "I did not ask your advice."}
{"prompt": "Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.", "completion": "Insolent -- Berlin manners."}
{"prompt": "I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.", "completion": "Most imposters are --"}
{"prompt": "Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.", "completion": "It seems that he was a thief and an imposter."}
{"prompt": "Good heavens. What for?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "What? -- Who? -- Whom?", "completion": "The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern."}
{"prompt": "No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?", "completion": "News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four."}
{"prompt": "Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.", "completion": "And the child isn't coming?"}
{"prompt": "Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.", "completion": "The night clerk has already gone -- you are late."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.", "completion": "Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --"}
{"prompt": "If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.", "completion": "The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned."}
{"prompt": "For me?", "completion": "No -- letters to two-eighty."}
{"prompt": "No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.", "completion": "Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought."}
{"prompt": "Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.", "completion": "For me?"}
{"prompt": "Is that for me?", "completion": "No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought."}
{"prompt": "Any letters?", "completion": "No, doctor."}
{"prompt": "Anyone asked for me?", "completion": "Nobody, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "Telegrams?", "completion": "No, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "Any letters?", "completion": "No, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "You've nothing to fear, Kringelein", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Stay where you are.", "completion": "No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks."}
{"prompt": "Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?", "completion": "Oh, I've got to find it."}
{"prompt": "There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.", "completion": "More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook."}
{"prompt": "Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.", "completion": "I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not..."}
{"prompt": "I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.", "completion": "Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain."}
{"prompt": "I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.", "completion": "Excuse me, gentlemen."}
{"prompt": "I'm always alone -- I have been everything.", "completion": "Everything?"}
{"prompt": "You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.", "completion": "Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world."}
{"prompt": "A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...", "completion": "I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important."}
{"prompt": "Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?", "completion": "What, Doctor?"}
{"prompt": "Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?", "completion": "For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold."}
{"prompt": "No pain, Mr. Kringelein?", "completion": "Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it..."}
{"prompt": "Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.", "completion": "Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron."}
{"prompt": "Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.", "completion": "But Doctor --"}
{"prompt": "The Grand Hotel.", "completion": "Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --"}
{"prompt": "I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.", "completion": "Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --", "completion": "You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?"}
{"prompt": "You are ill.", "completion": "I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill."}
{"prompt": "You're tired. I can see that.", "completion": "Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill..."}
{"prompt": "Send his bags up to my room.", "completion": "Oh -- but -- I --"}
{"prompt": "This gentleman can have my room.", "completion": "Oh!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.", "completion": "I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang..."}
{"prompt": "Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?", "completion": "How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?"}
{"prompt": "You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.", "completion": "Am I!"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, of course.", "completion": "Do you like me better?"}
{"prompt": "Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.", "completion": "Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?"}
{"prompt": "Later?", "completion": "When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until..."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.", "completion": "Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel."}
{"prompt": "You don't understand that do you?", "completion": "Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?"}
{"prompt": "Money!", "completion": "Yes, of course, -- money!"}
{"prompt": "I didn't like Preysing right off.", "completion": "Then why did you have anything to do with him?"}
{"prompt": "Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.", "completion": "He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him."}
{"prompt": "Yes --", "completion": "So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.", "completion": "You loved the Baron, didn't you?"}
{"prompt": "Preysing?", "completion": "What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --", "completion": "Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --"}
{"prompt": "Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.", "completion": "Oh -- what -- what --"}
{"prompt": "Please -- please!", "completion": "You don't like to see me enjoying myself."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "For the first time in my life, I'm happy."}
{"prompt": "You dance splendidly.", "completion": "I'm happy, Miss Flaemm."}
{"prompt": "You're trembling.", "completion": "I never danced before -- in public."}
{"prompt": "You must look at my face and not at the floor.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Dance then?", "completion": "She's beautiful -- isn't she?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --", "completion": "Oh -- you would!"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --", "completion": "A man might what?"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- that --", "completion": "You like music?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.", "completion": "No - absinthe."}
{"prompt": "I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --", "completion": "Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice."}
{"prompt": "To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.", "completion": "Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?"}
{"prompt": "I'm engaged for the evening.", "completion": "Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?"}
{"prompt": "Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.", "completion": "Oh, don't go."}
{"prompt": "Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.", "completion": "Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like."}
{"prompt": "Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.", "completion": "I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes."}
{"prompt": "You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?", "completion": "You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch."}
{"prompt": "Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.", "completion": "Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me."}
{"prompt": "It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.", "completion": "If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us."}
{"prompt": "I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.", "completion": "You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.", "completion": "Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?"}
{"prompt": "Come here.", "completion": "Here, hold up!"}

{"prompt": "You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.", "completion": "I had to arrange about the trip."}
{"prompt": "Baron!", "completion": "Well, he's a gentleman!"}
{"prompt": "Insolent young cub!", "completion": "You mean Baron von Gaigern?"}
{"prompt": "Can you pay some attention to me?", "completion": "Oh, yes."}
{"prompt": "A thousand marks --", "completion": "It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you."}
{"prompt": "Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?", "completion": "Of course -- of course."}
{"prompt": "I understand perfectly.", "completion": "What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?"}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --"}
{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "I must go to England -- at once."}
{"prompt": "Well -- you want me?", "completion": "Yes."}

{"prompt": "Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.", "completion": "I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "No -- now.", "completion": "Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern."}
{"prompt": "I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.", "completion": "Tomorrow morning."}
{"prompt": "It's urgent.", "completion": "Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.", "completion": "Presently, Mr. Preysing."}
{"prompt": "Miss Flaemm.", "completion": "Hello!"}
{"prompt": "Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?", "completion": "That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock."}
{"prompt": "Is that Mrs. Preysing.", "completion": "Definitely off."}
{"prompt": "How nice -- your daughters?", "completion": "My daughters -- yes, my daughters."}
{"prompt": "Should throw a great weight into the balance...", "completion": "...weight into the balance..."}
{"prompt": "Have you got it now?", "completion": "Cotton Company --"}
{"prompt": "Can't you understand me?", "completion": "I understand you perfectly."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You're a little too fast."}
{"prompt": "Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...", "completion": "Not too quickly."}
{"prompt": "With the same friend?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --", "completion": "Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too."}

{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Only in mutual advantages -- moreover."}
{"prompt": "You...", "completion": "Moreover..."}
{"prompt": "You...", "completion": "Me."}
{"prompt": "What is this?", "completion": "I got ten marks for that."}
{"prompt": "Movies?", "completion": "Yes, I photograph very well. Look --"}
{"prompt": "Moreover...", "completion": "I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies."}
{"prompt": "You're a very unusual stenographer --", "completion": "Moreover..."}
{"prompt": "Tired?", "completion": "You pay me."}
{"prompt": "Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?", "completion": "No -- only occasional jobs."}
{"prompt": "Moreover...", "completion": "Moreover..."}
{"prompt": "Moreover --", "completion": "Moreover --"}
{"prompt": "I'm the stenographer.", "completion": "Then you will please wait outside."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.", "completion": "What...! --"}
{"prompt": "Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?", "completion": "What we want to know about is Manchester."}
{"prompt": "Shhh -- here he is now.", "completion": "Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple."}
{"prompt": "Exactly.", "completion": "If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself."}
{"prompt": "Next week.", "completion": "And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down."}
{"prompt": "Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.", "completion": "See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details."}
{"prompt": "I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.", "completion": "Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter."}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.", "completion": "Preysing, you're joking with us."}
{"prompt": "Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.", "completion": "If you actually have news from Manchester then..."}
{"prompt": "Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yes --", "completion": "Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've..."}
{"prompt": "Yes --", "completion": "Then, it's all over?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry, Preysing.", "completion": "You've decided against the merger?"}
{"prompt": "Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "And I said we didn't.", "completion": "Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year."}
{"prompt": "Of course you took the initiative.", "completion": "I know you did -- I said you did --"}
{"prompt": "Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.", "completion": "Scratched --  We did not take the initiative."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...", "completion": "We did not approach you."}
{"prompt": "All you have to do is phone for it.", "completion": "Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious..."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --", "completion": "No water -- What a place!"}
{"prompt": "Mop rags --!", "completion": "I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!", "completion": "I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --"}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages."}
{"prompt": "I mean with the Manchester people?", "completion": "We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning."}
{"prompt": "There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?", "completion": "We have a good many connections in England, naturally."}
{"prompt": "They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.", "completion": "Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?"}
{"prompt": "What a session this has been.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.", "completion": "Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here."}
{"prompt": "I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.", "completion": "Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties..."}
{"prompt": "We did not approach you.", "completion": "...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?"}
{"prompt": "Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.", "completion": "As you remember it -- when you approached us..."}
{"prompt": "Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?", "completion": "Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger..."}
{"prompt": "In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...", "completion": "How clear is Manchester?"}
{"prompt": "Ah, come on -- we're going home.", "completion": "You're a deep one."}
{"prompt": "Why waste time -- it's getting late.", "completion": "You see -- what we are interested in --"}
{"prompt": "He likes to play the great man.", "completion": "Shall I tell them again?"}
{"prompt": "Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?", "completion": "Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting."}
{"prompt": "Goodnight, Suzette.", "completion": "Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs."}
{"prompt": "In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.", "completion": "Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train."}
{"prompt": "I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?", "completion": "When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently."}
{"prompt": "Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.", "completion": "Madam should sleep."}
{"prompt": "Madam will dress now, it is late.", "completion": "Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring."}
{"prompt": "Madam has slept well?", "completion": "Oh, yes, Suzette."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Suzette.", "completion": "Good morning, Madam."}
{"prompt": "Oh, come, Madam -- please come.", "completion": "All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry."}
{"prompt": "Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.", "completion": "Send it away -- I shan't need it."}
{"prompt": "Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --", "completion": "Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet."}
{"prompt": "Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --", "completion": "The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!"}
{"prompt": "But, Madam. cannot do that.", "completion": "Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough."}
{"prompt": "It will pass -- it will pass -- come.", "completion": "Let us cancel the engagement."}

{"prompt": "I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.", "completion": "Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep."}
{"prompt": "Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --", "completion": "Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days."}
{"prompt": "Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.", "completion": "Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself."}
{"prompt": "I wish to be alone.", "completion": "You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end."}
{"prompt": "Such nonsense.", "completion": "I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement."}
{"prompt": "You haven't time.", "completion": "Hurry, Suzette."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Take them back, Suzette."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- but it can't be.", "completion": "Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight."}
{"prompt": "The house is not full -- Is it really full?", "completion": "Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --"}
{"prompt": "Oh!", "completion": "Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof."}
{"prompt": "What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?", "completion": "I'm cancelling the engagement."}
{"prompt": "He will be on the train.", "completion": "But when did he go? How do you know?"}
{"prompt": "Gru -- you are positively radiant.", "completion": "Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, Pimenov.", "completion": "Good morning, Gru -- your --"}
{"prompt": "There was -- there was.", "completion": "That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished."}
{"prompt": "What -- what is it? Last night...", "completion": "Last night?... There was no applause."}
{"prompt": "The performance -- the performance -- the performance.", "completion": "It is not stage fright -- it's something more --"}
{"prompt": "Please.", "completion": "It is time for the performance."}
{"prompt": "Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.", "completion": "Again?"}
{"prompt": "Certainly, sir.", "completion": "Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.", "completion": "Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?"}
{"prompt": "How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.", "completion": "Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four."}
{"prompt": "The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.", "completion": "We must call the police, your excellency."}
{"prompt": "I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?", "completion": "Yes, I know them --"}
{"prompt": "Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.", "completion": "Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing."}
{"prompt": "No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.", "completion": "Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron."}
{"prompt": "-- We must do something...", "completion": "Yes, the police must be called."}
{"prompt": "He tried to rob me -- he is dead --", "completion": "My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that."}
{"prompt": "Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.", "completion": "Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron."}
{"prompt": "You're discharged.", "completion": "Me?"}
{"prompt": "Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.", "completion": "An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing."}
{"prompt": "Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.", "completion": "Go away -- go away."}
{"prompt": "Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?", "completion": "What is this insolence?"}
{"prompt": "Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?", "completion": "You may go, Mr. Kringelein."}
{"prompt": "You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.", "completion": "Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.", "completion": "I could not think of not accepting."}
{"prompt": "I don't know you.", "completion": "Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor."}
{"prompt": "I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.", "completion": "I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?"}
{"prompt": "No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.", "completion": "The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine."}
{"prompt": "Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?", "completion": "Just one moment, sir."}
{"prompt": "I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.", "completion": "It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir."}
{"prompt": "Madam Grusinskaya's car.", "completion": "If you will wait one moment, sir."}
{"prompt": "Four minutes past. Please come.", "completion": "Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there."}
{"prompt": "What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.", "completion": "The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?"}
{"prompt": "If the house is empty again, I don't know --", "completion": "When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people."}
{"prompt": "How is the house?", "completion": "Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz."}
{"prompt": "We will wait.", "completion": "You are late. Hurry."}
{"prompt": "Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.", "completion": "Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight."}
{"prompt": "Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?", "completion": "Pretty as a picture."}
{"prompt": "I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.", "completion": "She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry."}
{"prompt": "Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...", "completion": "What do you want with her?"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.", "completion": "I can understand that -- after your -- uh --"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.", "completion": "What you need is some relaxation."}
{"prompt": "No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...", "completion": "You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through."}
{"prompt": "That.", "completion": "'Deal with Manchester definitely off! \"Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you."}
{"prompt": "Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.", "completion": "What's bluff?"}
{"prompt": "You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?", "completion": "What's the matter with you?"}
{"prompt": "Well -- gentlemen.", "completion": "Next week."}
{"prompt": "But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --", "completion": "I can make no statement about Manchester at this time."}
{"prompt": "Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.", "completion": "Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?"}
{"prompt": "I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.", "completion": "Good night."}
{"prompt": "Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.", "completion": "I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white."}
{"prompt": "Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.", "completion": "Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise."}
{"prompt": "I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---", "completion": "No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?"}
{"prompt": "Everything depends on the Manchester merger.", "completion": "I know -- I know."}
{"prompt": "No news yet?", "completion": "No. No word."}
{"prompt": "Have I kept you waiting?", "completion": "Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester."}
{"prompt": "I will. So long, Bobo.", "completion": "Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz."}
{"prompt": "Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.", "completion": "Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me."}
{"prompt": "You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.", "completion": "Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing."}
{"prompt": "Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.", "completion": "You know it, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?", "completion": "You're a thousand percent right!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.", "completion": "That's right. Take a little, leave a little."}
{"prompt": "On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?", "completion": "Not skimming a thing, Lilly?"}
{"prompt": "See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.", "completion": "He's a good kid. A salesman."}
{"prompt": "You want a drink?", "completion": "Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez."}
{"prompt": "Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.", "completion": "Oh, thanks, Bobo."}
{"prompt": "Permanent damage.", "completion": "You'll never shit right again."}
{"prompt": "It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...", "completion": "What's that, Lilly?"}
{"prompt": "You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.", "completion": "And if you do it wrong?"}
{"prompt": "You mean, the insurance frammis?", "completion": "Tell me about the oranges, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "I'll loan you a raincoat.", "completion": "You ever hear about the oranges?"}
{"prompt": "You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.", "completion": "You're calling the shots."}
{"prompt": "I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.", "completion": "It'll never happen again. I swear."}
{"prompt": "I never fucked up before, Bobo.", "completion": "You expect me to buy this?"}
{"prompt": "He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.", "completion": "Motherhood."}
{"prompt": "My son was in the hospital --", "completion": "What the fuck are you doin with a son?"}
{"prompt": "My son --", "completion": "Your what?"}
{"prompt": "Bobo, no, I --", "completion": "You wanna talk to me straight up?"}
{"prompt": "I want to keep my teeth.", "completion": "Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!"}
{"prompt": "I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--", "completion": "One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.", "completion": "You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?"}
{"prompt": "You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.", "completion": "How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?"}
{"prompt": "Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?", "completion": "Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for."}
{"prompt": "No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.", "completion": "Hi, Bobo."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call."}
{"prompt": "Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?", "completion": "Right in front of the room."}
{"prompt": "Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?", "completion": "I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert."}
{"prompt": "I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.", "completion": "Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean."}
{"prompt": "Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.", "completion": "Oh, everything's the same size, same price."}
{"prompt": "Hah.", "completion": "Evening. Welcome to Phoenix."}
{"prompt": "I like you, too.", "completion": "Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house."}
{"prompt": "Roy? He's always crying.", "completion": "The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?", "completion": "Your kid's in the back here. He's crying."}
{"prompt": "It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.", "completion": "Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!"}
{"prompt": "Can't move.", "completion": "It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation."}
{"prompt": "Henry, no!", "completion": "Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?"}
{"prompt": "We're not really interested, Henry.", "completion": "You ruined me! You destroyed me!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.", "completion": "Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer."}
{"prompt": "Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.", "completion": "Want a look?"}
{"prompt": "Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...", "completion": "So here we are!"}
{"prompt": "Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --", "completion": "Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could..."}
{"prompt": "Goody!", "completion": "Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --"}
{"prompt": "Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?", "completion": "Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!", "completion": "Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely."}
{"prompt": "You brought a case? Good.", "completion": "Mary Beth, what we have here, uh..."}
{"prompt": "Here you are! Two rich people!", "completion": "I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried."}
{"prompt": "Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.", "completion": "These machines -- They're in here."}
{"prompt": "Not much time.", "completion": "We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately."}
{"prompt": "Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.", "completion": "Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in."}
{"prompt": "One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?", "completion": "You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?"}
{"prompt": "I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.", "completion": "The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?"}
{"prompt": "I certainly hope not.", "completion": "Loose talk is the one thing I worry about."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?", "completion": "And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks."}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes, but that's --", "completion": "My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed."}
{"prompt": "His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.", "completion": "You know who I work for."}
{"prompt": "Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.", "completion": "Well, make it stop!"}
{"prompt": "The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.", "completion": "What? He's going to be all right!"}
{"prompt": "Take two, three days. Call when you get there.", "completion": "Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way."}
{"prompt": "Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.", "completion": "Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'd have to see it, of course.", "completion": "You are seeing it. You're looking right at it."}
{"prompt": "You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...", "completion": "I have only one thing now. Are you interested?"}
{"prompt": "I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.", "completion": "It's not your fault."}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "I'll get you a check."}
{"prompt": "It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?", "completion": "Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars."}
{"prompt": "But they must be! They cut glass!", "completion": "Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?"}
{"prompt": "What is?", "completion": "This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry."}
{"prompt": "But what's wrong?", "completion": "I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see."}
{"prompt": "Why? What's wrong?", "completion": "You are a valued customer, as you know."}
{"prompt": "Fair enough.", "completion": "Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.", "completion": "That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.", "completion": "Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too."}
{"prompt": "Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...", "completion": "A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about."}
{"prompt": "The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --", "completion": "Perk, remember?"}
{"prompt": "I guess I'm just not a leader of men.", "completion": "Oh, come on, Roy."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.", "completion": "You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy."}
{"prompt": "Perk.", "completion": "Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --"}
{"prompt": "Oh, sure. Fine.", "completion": "And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid."}
{"prompt": "Well...", "completion": "See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?"}
{"prompt": "But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --", "completion": "I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer."}
{"prompt": "I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --", "completion": "I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?"}
{"prompt": "Well, uh... No.", "completion": "No?"}
{"prompt": "What? Me?", "completion": "That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "Sounds like a good Idea.", "completion": "I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent."}
{"prompt": "Just myself.", "completion": "That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "So I heard.", "completion": "Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?"}
{"prompt": "Lead on.", "completion": "When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally."}
{"prompt": "That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.", "completion": "You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.", "completion": "What's up?"}
{"prompt": "Kaggs. Home office.", "completion": "Roy Dillon."}
{"prompt": "Whadaya say?", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --", "completion": "NO!"}
{"prompt": "I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?", "completion": "Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "There's nothing more to talk about."}
{"prompt": "Just trying to help, Lilly.", "completion": "Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?"}
{"prompt": "That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...", "completion": ") That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power."}
{"prompt": "If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?", "completion": "A future. The only future I've got."}
{"prompt": "And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.", "completion": "Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.", "completion": "Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out."}
{"prompt": "Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.", "completion": "Well, uh..."}
{"prompt": "If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?", "completion": "I don't see why not."}
{"prompt": "That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.", "completion": "I don't?"}
{"prompt": "You're getting off the grift?", "completion": "That's right."}
{"prompt": "I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.", "completion": "For God's sake, Lilly!"}
{"prompt": "No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.", "completion": "What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself."}
{"prompt": "I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.", "completion": "Never."}
{"prompt": "A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.", "completion": "Uh-huh."}
{"prompt": "Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.", "completion": "Not very good!"}
{"prompt": "I know what's bugging you, of course.", "completion": "Oh? I didn't know anything was."}
{"prompt": "You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.", "completion": "Oh, you'll live, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.", "completion": "I'll get it."}
{"prompt": "I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.", "completion": "No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "You want a drink?"}
{"prompt": "I know you do, so that's why --", "completion": "And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this."}
{"prompt": "I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --", "completion": "Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive."}
{"prompt": "I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --", "completion": "Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --"}
{"prompt": "Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.", "completion": "Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there."}
{"prompt": "You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.", "completion": "A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!"}
{"prompt": "Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.", "completion": "At what?"}
{"prompt": "And Myra's stuff?", "completion": "Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?"}
{"prompt": "You must have some money.", "completion": "Just a few bucks."}
{"prompt": "Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.", "completion": "I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead."}
{"prompt": "You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.", "completion": "I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --"}
{"prompt": "This way's perfect.", "completion": "It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --"}
{"prompt": "That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?", "completion": "I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?"}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.", "completion": "As though you do what I say."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?"}
{"prompt": "Myra followed you, huh?", "completion": "She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?"}
{"prompt": "Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.", "completion": "Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down."}
{"prompt": "Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.", "completion": "Why should they? The cops are satisfied."}
{"prompt": "I've really got to --", "completion": "You're dead, Lilly, it worked."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?", "completion": "Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it."}
{"prompt": "Somewhere else, that's for sure.", "completion": "I just came back from Phoenix."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's good news.", "completion": "Going somewhere?"}
{"prompt": "You, too, Roy.", "completion": "Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know."}
{"prompt": "After the meet. Back to Baltimore.", "completion": "Well... nice to see you again, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.", "completion": "I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?"}
{"prompt": "You ought to put a bandage on that.", "completion": "No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air."}
{"prompt": "Expecting visitors?", "completion": "No. That was the point."}
{"prompt": "I pay my debts.", "completion": "You do?"}
{"prompt": "Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?", "completion": "Roy, I don't want money from you."}
{"prompt": "We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.", "completion": "If you come out to the track, don't know me."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?"}
{"prompt": "You don't have the stomach for it.", "completion": "I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you."}
{"prompt": "Get off the grift, Roy.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?", "completion": "I tripped over a chair."}
{"prompt": "He let me live. He let me be his friend.", "completion": "You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!"}
{"prompt": "I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.", "completion": "Lucky? You call that lucky?"}
{"prompt": "That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.", "completion": "Bluebell came in?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be."}
{"prompt": "Up to you.", "completion": "My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down."}
{"prompt": "Not as tough as you, huh?", "completion": "No. And you have to be."}
{"prompt": "That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --", "completion": "How come?"}
{"prompt": "You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!", "completion": "You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob."}
{"prompt": "And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!", "completion": "I like those."}
{"prompt": "Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?", "completion": "It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself."}
{"prompt": "Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?", "completion": "What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?"}
{"prompt": "Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.", "completion": "I can take care of my own bills, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "You always did.", "completion": "What happened to your hand?"}
{"prompt": "Don't mention it.", "completion": "I guess I owe you my life."}
{"prompt": "Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.", "completion": "Thanks, uh, Lilly."}
{"prompt": "I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.", "completion": "Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?"}
{"prompt": "Only one tooth?", "completion": "Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?"}
{"prompt": "Only one arm?", "completion": "They knocked out my tooth!"}
{"prompt": "So what's your story today?", "completion": "They twisted my arm."}
{"prompt": "This time...", "completion": "We'll work something out, Joe."}
{"prompt": "My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.", "completion": "I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?"}
{"prompt": "Joe, you know you'll --", "completion": "Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?"}
{"prompt": "Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --", "completion": "It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money."}
{"prompt": "You heard the shower, didn't you?", "completion": "I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent."}
{"prompt": "Where's the five?", "completion": "In your other hand."}
{"prompt": "You're too young. You should be in school.", "completion": "I am in school."}
{"prompt": "Scram. Go home.", "completion": "I can't. I just left home."}
{"prompt": "You taught me a lot. Then I invented.", "completion": "Let me see how you did that one."}
{"prompt": "I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --", "completion": "I didn't teach you that."}
{"prompt": "Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?", "completion": "You watch that mouth."}
{"prompt": "Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.", "completion": ") What?"}
{"prompt": "What is it? What's going on?", "completion": "I'm happy the way I am."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit!", "completion": "No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you."}
{"prompt": "For Christ's sake, why not?", "completion": "Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What I say is, no. We don't do partners."}
{"prompt": "No! Because I --", "completion": "That's what I say."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I like it where I am.", "completion": "Don't I get any say in this?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think I need it.", "completion": "You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day."}
{"prompt": "The last I looked, we were just talking things over.", "completion": "But the setup's there. It's there now."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "And hello to you, too.", "completion": "I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --"}
{"prompt": "You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.", "completion": "Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?"}
{"prompt": "But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?", "completion": "Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out."}
{"prompt": "You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.", "completion": "Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard."}
{"prompt": "I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.", "completion": "Running your broker scam, you mean."}
{"prompt": "I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.", "completion": "You must have some very knowledgeable friends."}
{"prompt": "I saw her.", "completion": "She didn't see you, in other words."}
{"prompt": "I went out to Delmar.", "completion": ") The track? Did you run into Lilly?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, come here.", "completion": "You were gone for a while."}
{"prompt": "You -- I don't know.", "completion": ") If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!"}
{"prompt": "What?  What for?", "completion": "Open it and find out."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "Open your door."}
{"prompt": "You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.", "completion": "Sure. I'm pretty tired myself."}
{"prompt": "Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.", "completion": "Things a man isn't supposed to know."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?"}
{"prompt": "Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?", "completion": "Think about it. Okay?"}
{"prompt": "I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.", "completion": "I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them."}
{"prompt": "Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...", "completion": "Take a hike, you mean?"}
{"prompt": "That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?", "completion": "I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me."}
{"prompt": "Upstate where?", "completion": "Atascadero."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "Upstate."}
{"prompt": "What happened to Cole?", "completion": "He retired."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? How?", "completion": "Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year."}
{"prompt": "And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.", "completion": "No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off."}
{"prompt": "I thought these people were broke.", "completion": "No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole."}
{"prompt": "And when he got serious?", "completion": "He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!"}
{"prompt": "It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.", "completion": "He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark."}
{"prompt": "It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.", "completion": "Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.", "completion": "I've heard the name."}
{"prompt": "The long end. Big con.", "completion": "Nobody does that single-o."}
{"prompt": "Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.", "completion": "You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?"}
{"prompt": "You're on the grift. Same as me.", "completion": "Myra, I'm not following this."}
{"prompt": "The tap. What you do for a living.", "completion": "I'm a salesman."}
{"prompt": "Working the what?", "completion": "Oh, come on, Roy."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys."}
{"prompt": "Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.", "completion": "You already went back to work."}
{"prompt": "You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.", "completion": "I'll sign that affidavit."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "See you soon."}
{"prompt": "Big spender.", "completion": "You ain't seen nothin."}
{"prompt": "What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?", "completion": "We'll rent a car."}
{"prompt": "I don't see why we have to take the train.", "completion": "Because it's comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Every day in every way.", "completion": "I'll see you when you get home."}
{"prompt": "You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.", "completion": "Get well soon."}
{"prompt": "And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.", "completion": "Oh, don't be stupid."}
{"prompt": "I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.", "completion": "That's just Lilly's way."}
{"prompt": "Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.", "completion": "I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that."}
{"prompt": "You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.", "completion": "Mama!"}
{"prompt": "I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.", "completion": "I just do what the doctor says, babe."}
{"prompt": "I want to know everything about you.", "completion": "You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?", "completion": "Her job."}
{"prompt": "You called the doctor, huh?", "completion": "Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you."}
{"prompt": "No, baby. Come to Mama.", "completion": "You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.", "completion": "Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?"}
{"prompt": "No more than this?", "completion": "What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?"}
{"prompt": "Roy? It this all we have?", "completion": "All? It ain't bad."}
{"prompt": "Look at me.", "completion": "Oh, I am, baby, believe me."}
{"prompt": "Roy?", "completion": "Mm?"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure?", "completion": "Let's find out."}
{"prompt": "Taking you for granite?", "completion": "That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all."}
{"prompt": "Always, for you, baby.", "completion": "You aren't taking me for granted, are you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. That's that.", "completion": "Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?"}
{"prompt": "No, its -- Why did she--?", "completion": "That's that, then."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Jesus.", "completion": "No question, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Not many laughs in this room, eh?", "completion": "Not many."}
{"prompt": "Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.", "completion": "Well, let's get the shock over with."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.", "completion": "Ate the gun. Oh."}
{"prompt": "Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...", "completion": "Yes, I know, I know."}
{"prompt": "You up to it now?", "completion": "Sure. Let's get it over."}
{"prompt": "A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.", "completion": "Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?"}
{"prompt": "Do you have any particular reason to say that?", "completion": "My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day."}
{"prompt": "I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.", "completion": "It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.", "completion": "Gun?"}
{"prompt": "That's natural.", "completion": "No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out."}
{"prompt": "I realize this is a shock.", "completion": "Well, mostly, I don't believe it."}
{"prompt": "Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Roy Dillon?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.", "completion": "Happy to see you looking so good."}
{"prompt": "That's true, Mr. Simms.", "completion": "We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves."}
{"prompt": "Well, thank you. And thank them.", "completion": "Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon."}
{"prompt": "Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--", "completion": "Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by."}
{"prompt": "Toni Blake from Langley P.D.", "completion": "Mr. Simms."}
{"prompt": "The door was open, so we let ourselves in.", "completion": "Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D."}
{"prompt": "It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?", "completion": "We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate."}
{"prompt": "Sweet dreams, Blake.", "completion": "Carter."}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Care to join me?", "completion": "Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael."}
{"prompt": "Charming.", "completion": "That's it?"}
{"prompt": "Only the real stiffs.", "completion": "I can be real stiff."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.", "completion": "You take all your dates here. Blake?"}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "The cemetery..."}
{"prompt": "Carter.", "completion": "It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View."}
{"prompt": "Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?", "completion": "Girl scouts."}
{"prompt": "As which point she drops to her knees in pain...", "completion": "Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains..."}
{"prompt": "The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.", "completion": "Broken blood vessels on her right forearm."}
{"prompt": "Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.", "completion": "No blood on the knife."}
{"prompt": "That don't match either of the victim's.", "completion": "Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell."}
{"prompt": "I like a woman who takes control.", "completion": "One set of muddy shoe prints."}
{"prompt": "Well, when you put it that way.", "completion": "Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?"}
{"prompt": "With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.", "completion": "Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?"}
{"prompt": "Why am I here?", "completion": "They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case."}

{"prompt": "Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.", "completion": "I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times."}

{"prompt": "A dead body?", "completion": "It's Amy Kramer."}
{"prompt": "Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.", "completion": "Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there."}

{"prompt": "Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?", "completion": "It's not historically accurate, that's all."}

{"prompt": "Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.", "completion": "Besides, it's historically inaccurate."}
{"prompt": "Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.", "completion": "My office?"}
{"prompt": "Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...", "completion": "Nothing's missing?"}

{"prompt": "My life is a living hell.", "completion": "Where are you going?"}

{"prompt": "The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?", "completion": "My point exactly.  See, we both agree."}
{"prompt": "I promise not to run off to Cancun.", "completion": "Forget it."}
{"prompt": "Well, Dad thinks it's okay.", "completion": "You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count."}

{"prompt": "I'm okay.", "completion": "Here, take my jacket."}
{"prompt": "I guess.  It's just hard to believe.", "completion": "You look kind of cold."}
{"prompt": "You really think Eddie killed her?", "completion": "You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.", "completion": "Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet."}
{"prompt": "Then you come out here.", "completion": "Then I'll get caught."}
{"prompt": "Can I come in?", "completion": "Are you crazy?  You'll get caught."}
{"prompt": "I came to see you.", "completion": "I can see that.  Why?"}
{"prompt": "Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.", "completion": "What are you doing here?!"}
{"prompt": "I can't afford to get caught.", "completion": "Nah, I didn't tell her where I went."}
{"prompt": "Not me.", "completion": "Why not?"}

{"prompt": "Are you going to leave, too?", "completion": "Never."}
{"prompt": "Shit happens.", "completion": "You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it."}
{"prompt": "No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.", "completion": "I can't believe this is happening."}
{"prompt": "The serial killer?", "completion": "He's my brother."}

{"prompt": "A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.", "completion": "Bye Will."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't make it bad advice.", "completion": "I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?"}
{"prompt": "The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.", "completion": "Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?"}
{"prompt": "This kid just wants his freedom.", "completion": "It's not going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Still wants to move out?", "completion": "He's been living out of moving boxes for three months."}
{"prompt": "It's John, isn't it?", "completion": "It's always John."}
{"prompt": "You okay?  You seem a little off.", "completion": "Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix."}
{"prompt": "Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?", "completion": "Looks great.  It does."}
{"prompt": "Can't you hold it?", "completion": "Can't you?"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "I have to pee."}
{"prompt": "You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?", "completion": "Wait."}
{"prompt": "Oh, don't be such a victim.", "completion": "Look, they're staring right at us."}
{"prompt": "Let the party begin.", "completion": "Have enough fun for the both of us."}

{"prompt": "Shane's going as a condom.", "completion": "I thought you were allergic to latex."}

{"prompt": "No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.", "completion": "You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely."}
{"prompt": "Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?", "completion": "Why?  You interested?"}
{"prompt": "Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.", "completion": "Pig.  What the hell happened this time?"}
{"prompt": "What if it's Kara?", "completion": "He do that to you?"}
{"prompt": "Aren't you gonna answer that?", "completion": "Answer what?"}
{"prompt": "What if your parents come home?", "completion": "Then they can watch."}
{"prompt": "Guess they -- went to the fair after all.", "completion": "Guess so ..."}
{"prompt": "But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --", "completion": "We can light our own tree at home."}
{"prompt": "Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?", "completion": "Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here."}
{"prompt": "Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?", "completion": "Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy."}
{"prompt": "Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.", "completion": "Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!"}
{"prompt": "Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.", "completion": "Happy fuckin' Halloween."}
{"prompt": "Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.", "completion": "Whatever happened to women in back?"}
{"prompt": "Danny!!!", "completion": "Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do."}
{"prompt": "I promise.", "completion": "Mommy!!!"}
{"prompt": "No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.", "completion": "Promise?"}

{"prompt": "Danny, you're just going to have to wait!", "completion": "Mommy, I'm scared."}
{"prompt": "You can't expect us to stay here --", "completion": "Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!"}

{"prompt": "Like what?", "completion": "No, Mom -- keep it on!"}
{"prompt": "You've been watching too much TV.", "completion": "He says things.  Bad things."}
{"prompt": "They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?", "completion": "But I've seen him!"}
{"prompt": "Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.", "completion": "The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here."}
{"prompt": "Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?", "completion": "The voice man!  He's here!"}
{"prompt": "Debra, you're fuckin' insane.", "completion": "You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew."}
{"prompt": "What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?", "completion": "I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --", "completion": "John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!"}
{"prompt": "A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.", "completion": "He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house."}
{"prompt": "You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.", "completion": "What is it this time?"}
{"prompt": "Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.", "completion": "See what I'm talkin' about?"}
{"prompt": "Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...", "completion": "Relax, John.  They were just kids."}
{"prompt": "God ... this can't be true.", "completion": "Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did."}
{"prompt": "What should I do?", "completion": "Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible."}
{"prompt": "Jamie?  But I thought she was --", "completion": "Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed."}
{"prompt": "What makes you think he'll come here again?", "completion": "This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter."}
{"prompt": "I've come to help your family.", "completion": "He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began."}
{"prompt": "I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?", "completion": "It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!"}
{"prompt": "So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.", "completion": "No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby."}

{"prompt": "Halloween.", "completion": "'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'"}
{"prompt": "Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.", "completion": "Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'"}
{"prompt": "It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --", "completion": "It's a rune ... Thorn."}

{"prompt": "Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.", "completion": "No!!!"}
{"prompt": "And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.", "completion": "You've created a monster."}
{"prompt": "There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.", "completion": "Samhain."}
{"prompt": "She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.", "completion": "Jamie's baby ..."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.", "completion": "Why did you take Jamie?"}
{"prompt": "Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.", "completion": "It was you."}
{"prompt": "Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.", "completion": "This is madness, Wynn."}
{"prompt": "Where's the child?", "completion": "Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you."}
{"prompt": "What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?", "completion": "I'll meet you over there."}
{"prompt": "No one's home.  Checked it out myself.", "completion": "Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house."}
{"prompt": "There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.", "completion": "Any word on the location of the Strodes?"}
{"prompt": "There you are.  Who was that boy?", "completion": "An old friend."}
{"prompt": "Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.", "completion": "I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to."}
{"prompt": "What is that?", "completion": "It's a sign.  He's come home."}
{"prompt": "Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.", "completion": "Or what's left of him."}
{"prompt": "After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --", "completion": "That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him."}
{"prompt": "You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.", "completion": "It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well."}
{"prompt": "Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.", "completion": "It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me."}
{"prompt": "You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.", "completion": "But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over."}
{"prompt": "We need you, Dr. Loomis.", "completion": "You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me."}
{"prompt": "But surely Rogers isn't --", "completion": "Retiring."}
{"prompt": "I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.", "completion": "As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff."}
{"prompt": "That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.", "completion": "Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink."}

{"prompt": "Goodbye, Looseleaf.", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "They were enemies.  We were at war.", "completion": "Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, \"Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much.\" You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one."}
{"prompt": "If what?", "completion": "If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, \"Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live.\""}

{"prompt": "You're an imbecile.", "completion": "I know you think that."}
{"prompt": "You.", "completion": "Okay.  Okay."}
{"prompt": "Maybe it's time you got out.", "completion": "Me?"}
{"prompt": "You did?", "completion": "Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, \"Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again.\" That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, \"Jesus--who could blame her?\""}
{"prompt": "Tit for tat--as simple as that.", "completion": "You never played a violin."}
{"prompt": "In what way, pray tell?", "completion": "I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!", "completion": "Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?"}
{"prompt": "She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.", "completion": "Hi, Penelope."}
{"prompt": "You know her for what she is now-- garbage.", "completion": "I dunno."}
{"prompt": "All the more reason to go to Africa.", "completion": "I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?"}
{"prompt": "You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.", "completion": "Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore."}
{"prompt": "Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.", "completion": "I dunno."}
{"prompt": "So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?", "completion": "He's a man.  Tell him you're a man."}
{"prompt": "It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.", "completion": "You keep on saying \"deep\" and \"deeply.\" I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime."}
{"prompt": "Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.", "completion": "I told you the uniform wouldn't help."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know we had any women left.", "completion": "The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy."}
{"prompt": "Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.", "completion": "When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women."}
{"prompt": "That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.", "completion": "Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare."}
{"prompt": "Go to the funeral?", "completion": "Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!"}
{"prompt": "You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, \"Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again.\"", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.", "completion": "Oh.  I'd forgotten."}
{"prompt": "You told me.", "completion": "When?"}
{"prompt": "He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.", "completion": "How do you know that?"}
{"prompt": "Huh.", "completion": "He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me.", "completion": "One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern."}
{"prompt": "What's funny about that?", "completion": "You know me, boy."}
{"prompt": "I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.", "completion": "She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night."}
{"prompt": "I dunno, boy.", "completion": "The educational process."}
{"prompt": "First Nagasaki--now this.", "completion": "How about breakfast, wife?"}
{"prompt": "I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.", "completion": "Could have happened to anybody."}
{"prompt": "Let's talk about something else.", "completion": "Otherwise, how are things?"}
{"prompt": "Haven't got one.", "completion": "And how were things?"}
{"prompt": "You ever own a motorcycle?", "completion": "You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!"}
{"prompt": "I've been looking at motorcycles.", "completion": "Go home!"}
{"prompt": "I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.", "completion": "I'm lonesome already."}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!", "completion": "Months?"}
{"prompt": "Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.", "completion": "You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!"}
{"prompt": "How short the skirts are.", "completion": "Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful."}
{"prompt": "You know what gets me?", "completion": "Let's talk about it some other time."}
{"prompt": "I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.", "completion": "So long, Colonel."}
{"prompt": "I'm liable to find anything!", "completion": "That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up."}
{"prompt": "When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.", "completion": "Go home."}
{"prompt": "You know what gets me about that Cadillac?", "completion": "Go home!"}
{"prompt": "What'll you do for transportation?", "completion": "I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!"}
{"prompt": "Can I have the Cadillac?", "completion": "Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care."}
{"prompt": "You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.", "completion": "Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!"}
{"prompt": "Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!", "completion": "The hell with the diamonds!"}
{"prompt": "You know what gets me?", "completion": "Go home!"}
{"prompt": "This room is full of ghosts.", "completion": "You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people."}
{"prompt": "The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.", "completion": "I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there."}
{"prompt": "After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!", "completion": "I didn't tell you everything."}
{"prompt": "Tell them yourself!", "completion": "You don't know my mother-in-law, boy."}
{"prompt": "It's enough that you've brought yourself home!", "completion": "I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler."}
{"prompt": "At least!", "completion": "I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home."}
{"prompt": "Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?", "completion": "At least we found the diamonds."}
{"prompt": "Oh, shit.", "completion": "How everybody says \"fuck\" and \"shit\" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say \"fuck\" or \"shit\" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says \"fuck\" and \"shit,\" \"fuck\" and \"shit\" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country."}
{"prompt": "You know what gets me?", "completion": "You know what gets me?"}
{"prompt": "Must have changed that law.", "completion": "Home."}
{"prompt": "Used to be against the law, didn't it?", "completion": "I suppose."}
{"prompt": "How all the magazines show tits today.", "completion": "Um."}
{"prompt": "You know what gets me?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!", "completion": "Home is important to a man."}
{"prompt": "We'll see.", "completion": "It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young."}
{"prompt": "Home, sweet home.", "completion": "One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week."}
{"prompt": "I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.", "completion": "I'm gonna wet my pants."}
{"prompt": "We've never met.", "completion": "I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants."}
{"prompt": "A bitch.", "completion": "Didn't recognize you."}
{"prompt": "Hm?", "completion": "It's a bitch."}
{"prompt": "Miss me, baby?", "completion": "I dunno, boy."}
{"prompt": "You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.", "completion": "Thank God!"}
{"prompt": "No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.", "completion": "Out!"}
{"prompt": "You're my buddy.", "completion": "Out!  Out!"}
{"prompt": "How do you know how I'd act in Africa?", "completion": "Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!"}
{"prompt": "I'm smarter than Looseleaf.", "completion": "He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't drop my gun.", "completion": "You're hollow, like a woman."}
{"prompt": "Gee whiz--", "completion": "It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us."}
{"prompt": "What went wrong?", "completion": "We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive."}
{"prompt": "You invited me.", "completion": "To make an ass of yourself."}
{"prompt": "For Africa.", "completion": "Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?"}
{"prompt": "We got to get another pilot.", "completion": "For what?"}
{"prompt": "Who's going to fly our helicopter now?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.", "completion": "Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!"}
{"prompt": "It's engineered to last about fifteen years.", "completion": "Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things."}
{"prompt": "You're making a joke.", "completion": "I'm interested in long-term expectations."}
{"prompt": "That can be arranged.", "completion": "Fifty years?"}
{"prompt": "Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.", "completion": "I just want one true adventure before I die."}
{"prompt": "It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.", "completion": "I've considered that."}
{"prompt": "What an awful sound!", "completion": "Get used to it.  Back door, Paul."}
{"prompt": "Insurance!", "completion": "You actually sold insurance!"}
{"prompt": "What you say is, \"Pass the fucking catsup.\"", "completion": "Pass the fucking catsup."}
{"prompt": "I'd rather go to Viet Nam.", "completion": "Would somebody please pass me the catsup?"}
{"prompt": "It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.", "completion": "Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?"}
{"prompt": "For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.", "completion": "Blue soup."}
{"prompt": "Our pleasure.", "completion": "Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.", "completion": "I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends."}
{"prompt": "I forgot my vacuum cleaner.", "completion": "I forget mine for years on end."}
{"prompt": "I wanted to apologize.", "completion": "You've come to the right man."}
{"prompt": "Is Penelope in?", "completion": "The posies are for her?"}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "How are you, honeybunch?"}
{"prompt": "I'm talking to you gently now.", "completion": "Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again."}
{"prompt": "Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.", "completion": "I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same."}
{"prompt": "Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!", "completion": "It's your house, Dad."}
{"prompt": "Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?", "completion": "I don't want to fight you."}
{"prompt": "Dad--", "completion": "Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`"}
{"prompt": "Gee whiz, Dad--", "completion": "Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!"}
{"prompt": "That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.", "completion": "Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Open the bolt!"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Of course it is.  Is it loaded?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "That's a rifle you have?"}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "What's this?"}
{"prompt": "It's Mom.", "completion": "Mom?"}
{"prompt": "Dad?", "completion": "Who was it?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word."}
{"prompt": "I'm a man.", "completion": "We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?"}
{"prompt": "What kind of exercise?", "completion": "Beat the shit out of someone who hates you."}
{"prompt": "A hundred dollars for breakfast?", "completion": "Leave a tip."}
{"prompt": "Dad--", "completion": "Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?"}
{"prompt": "Can I get dressed first?", "completion": "Make it fast."}
{"prompt": "A hundred dollars!", "completion": "The smallest thing I've got."}
{"prompt": "Play?", "completion": "Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours."}
{"prompt": "Damn.", "completion": "Mom?"}
{"prompt": "Scat!", "completion": "Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!"}
{"prompt": "Will you go to bed?", "completion": "Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks."}
{"prompt": "Penelope!", "completion": "She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her."}
{"prompt": "Penelope!", "completion": "She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime."}
{"prompt": "That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.", "completion": "Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead."}
{"prompt": "Can't it keep till morning?", "completion": "She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, \"Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes.\""}
{"prompt": "I can't take my eyes off you.", "completion": "Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?"}
{"prompt": "She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.", "completion": "Why don't you go to bed--son."}
{"prompt": "Is Looseleaf Harper alive?", "completion": "Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!"}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt."}
{"prompt": "Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.", "completion": "Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home."}
{"prompt": "No, no, no, no, no.", "completion": "I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may."}
{"prompt": "Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.", "completion": "You're a very good boy to respond that way."}
{"prompt": "They're not engaged.", "completion": "He seems to think they are.  He told me that were."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.", "completion": "Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?"}
{"prompt": "I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.", "completion": "You're supposed to get hurt!"}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?"}
{"prompt": "When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.", "completion": "It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more."}
{"prompt": "Mhravitch.", "completion": "The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch."}
{"prompt": "And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, \"Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\"", "completion": "Mhravitch.  Remember that name."}
{"prompt": "Where did you get the poison?", "completion": "We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time."}
{"prompt": "Go on.", "completion": "We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?"}
{"prompt": "Uck.", "completion": "Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?"}
{"prompt": "Mhravitch.", "completion": "We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound."}
{"prompt": "Wow.", "completion": "We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!"}
{"prompt": "Tell me that!  Tell me that!", "completion": "Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia."}
{"prompt": "Tell me that.", "completion": "I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand."}
{"prompt": "\"The sting.\"", "completion": "Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis."}
{"prompt": "\"The sting.\"", "completion": "As in \"Death, where is thy sting?\" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more."}
{"prompt": "Dad was never in England?", "completion": "Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him \"La Picadura\"--\"the sting.\""}
{"prompt": "England?", "completion": "Oh hell."}
{"prompt": "Tell me some true stories about Dad.", "completion": "\"Dad?\"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country."}
{"prompt": "He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?", "completion": "Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.", "completion": "Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure."}
{"prompt": "\"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.\"", "completion": "What does he do--of an athletic nature?"}
{"prompt": "He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "What's good about that?", "completion": "It makes life spicy."}
{"prompt": "He insults him all the time.", "completion": "Excellent!"}
{"prompt": "She has a master's degree in English literature.", "completion": "What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?"}
{"prompt": "They were in the same creative writing class.", "completion": "College?"}
{"prompt": "She met him at college.", "completion": "College!"}
{"prompt": "He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.", "completion": "I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--"}
{"prompt": "He worships Father.", "completion": "Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?"}
{"prompt": "Everybody says he was so brave.", "completion": "Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said?"}
{"prompt": "I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?", "completion": "Man and boy."}
{"prompt": "I'll see.", "completion": "And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?"}
{"prompt": "She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.", "completion": "You think you could find me a pencil and paper?"}
{"prompt": "Where's Mom?", "completion": "You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?"}
{"prompt": "Is anybody besides you here now?", "completion": "The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Woodly.", "completion": "Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list."}
{"prompt": "Do you mind if I ask who you are?", "completion": "Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago."}
{"prompt": "Do you know who Wanda June is?", "completion": "Life has denied me that thrill."}
{"prompt": "Are you--do you--", "completion": "Ask it!"}
{"prompt": "Are you--", "completion": "You were about to ask a question?"}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "Sir?", "completion": "As a matter of fact--I am home."}
{"prompt": "Anybody home?", "completion": "As a matter of fact--"}
{"prompt": "Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.", "completion": "Do it, Norbert."}
{"prompt": "Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!", "completion": "Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go."}
{"prompt": "Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?", "completion": "You've killed women?"}
{"prompt": "She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.", "completion": "Out!"}
{"prompt": "The National Safety Council would be appalled.", "completion": "Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool."}
{"prompt": "Load it for her.", "completion": "All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?"}
{"prompt": "There it is.  Give it to me.", "completion": "How do I load?"}
{"prompt": "Where's the bullet?", "completion": "Help your mother find the bullet."}
{"prompt": "I mean it!", "completion": "Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun."}
{"prompt": "I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.", "completion": "Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way."}
{"prompt": "I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.", "completion": "Ah!  The lady is armed."}
{"prompt": "No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?", "completion": "There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking."}
{"prompt": "This is suicide.  Go get the police.", "completion": "Stop!"}
{"prompt": "I'm going to call the police.", "completion": "Don't!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.", "completion": "You hope this, too?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?"}
{"prompt": "I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!", "completion": "The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore."}
{"prompt": "If you've lived a good life, fought well--", "completion": "It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all."}
{"prompt": "What a handsome word.", "completion": "But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed."}
{"prompt": "If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?", "completion": "Honor, I suppose."}
{"prompt": "I plan to live one hundred years!", "completion": "No you don't."}
{"prompt": "I'm teaching my son to be a man.", "completion": "So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you."}
{"prompt": "If he thinks he's man enough.", "completion": "That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead."}
{"prompt": "With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.", "completion": "You're begging him to kill you?"}
{"prompt": "Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!", "completion": "He's a child!"}
{"prompt": "Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!", "completion": "Like what?"}
{"prompt": "An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang \"Oh Promise Me.\" Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to \"Oh Promise Me\"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.", "completion": "Sounds quite beautiful."}
{"prompt": "What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.", "completion": "Blue soup?"}
{"prompt": "And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?", "completion": "It seems highly intelligent to me."}
{"prompt": "Last I heard, his mother was going alone.", "completion": "He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain."}
{"prompt": "I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?", "completion": "He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt."}
{"prompt": "He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.", "completion": "Rifle?"}
{"prompt": "See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.", "completion": "How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room."}
{"prompt": "Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.", "completion": "I see."}
{"prompt": "Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.", "completion": "I want you to tell me that you loved me once."}
{"prompt": "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.", "completion": "Just one favor."}
{"prompt": "Well--what have we here?  A family.", "completion": "Almost a Christmas scene."}
{"prompt": "Things.", "completion": "You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?"}
{"prompt": "He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.", "completion": "Hope."}
{"prompt": "Two hundred years old.", "completion": "He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention."}
{"prompt": "He cried.", "completion": "About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat."}
{"prompt": "He knows you shattered his violin.", "completion": "I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions."}
{"prompt": "Unless she has nerve.", "completion": "More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?"}
{"prompt": "Did you like it, dear?", "completion": "It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything."}
{"prompt": "A dozen?", "completion": "It's a big and busy funeral home."}
{"prompt": "You took him to the funeral, I hear.", "completion": "He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now."}
{"prompt": "I came for Paul as well.", "completion": "If he wants to go."}
{"prompt": "I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.", "completion": "Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation."}
{"prompt": "I came for my clothes.", "completion": "Sneaking in the back door."}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.", "completion": "No you're not!"}
{"prompt": "That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.", "completion": "What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt": "And no one's there now?", "completion": "I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "And he keeps it in his apartment?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "And what is his most cherished possession?", "completion": "His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess."}
{"prompt": "The doctor.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "You learned this in some college course?", "completion": "I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that."}
{"prompt": "Go on.", "completion": "And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge."}
{"prompt": "I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.", "completion": "Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there."}
{"prompt": "Tell me about its sexual roots.", "completion": "It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth."}
{"prompt": "Such as?...", "completion": "The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots."}
{"prompt": "Fish can't feel.", "completion": "Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you."}
{"prompt": "It couldn't!", "completion": "I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours."}
{"prompt": "You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!", "completion": "I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel."}
{"prompt": "That's what you're supposed to say.", "completion": "This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness."}
{"prompt": "What then?", "completion": "I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me."}
{"prompt": "Let me guess--breakfast is served?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?", "completion": "I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?"}
{"prompt": "Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.", "completion": "I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?"}
{"prompt": "People now have dignity when frying eggs?", "completion": "They don't have to feel like slaves."}
{"prompt": "Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!", "completion": "You leave me so--so without-- without dignity."}
{"prompt": "Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.", "completion": "People don't use that word any more."}
{"prompt": "We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.", "completion": "You're a woman, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!", "completion": "Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!"}
{"prompt": "Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.", "completion": "You're wrong."}
{"prompt": "She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!", "completion": "What a honeymoon."}
{"prompt": "Which one?", "completion": "\"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.\""}
{"prompt": "All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.", "completion": "That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips."}
{"prompt": "And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.", "completion": "Mrs. Wheeler is dead."}
{"prompt": "Breakfast?", "completion": "Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?"}
{"prompt": "I have some change!", "completion": "Ram it up your ass!"}
{"prompt": "I have a brain.", "completion": "We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl."}
{"prompt": "You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.", "completion": "You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time."}
{"prompt": "I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.", "completion": "I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense."}
{"prompt": "Now--turn around, if you would.", "completion": "Turn around?"}
{"prompt": "Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.", "completion": "I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!"}
{"prompt": "It's so--so stark.", "completion": "You used to like it stark!"}
{"prompt": "Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.", "completion": "Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!"}
{"prompt": "I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.", "completion": "He hasn't had breakfast yet."}
{"prompt": "We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.", "completion": "A trip, you mean?"}
{"prompt": "You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.", "completion": "I did?"}
{"prompt": "Now that's what I call fun.", "completion": "Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary."}
{"prompt": "Say hello to your mother.", "completion": "Do say hello to your mother."}
{"prompt": "He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.", "completion": "Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am."}
{"prompt": "You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--", "completion": "He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!"}
{"prompt": "I could carve a better man out of a banana!", "completion": "Please--"}
{"prompt": "Have some.", "completion": "Harold!"}
{"prompt": "Thank God!", "completion": "I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared."}
{"prompt": "You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.", "completion": "Nothing would please me more."}
{"prompt": "Paul said you were awfully sick.", "completion": "I was, I was.  It never lasts long."}
{"prompt": "Shouldn't you lie down?", "completion": "When I'm dead--  or fucking."}
{"prompt": "He's a very decent man, Harold.", "completion": "We all are."}
{"prompt": "We thought it was an emergency.", "completion": "I don't want that chancre mechanic in here."}
{"prompt": "We thought a doctor might help.", "completion": "Your old beau?"}
{"prompt": "You'd better get Dr. Woodly.", "completion": "What's that all about?"}
{"prompt": "Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.", "completion": "Bluh."}
{"prompt": "Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.", "completion": "You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?"}
{"prompt": "A telegram--a phone call might have helped.", "completion": "Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed."}
{"prompt": "Situation.", "completion": "This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.", "completion": "Disease?"}
{"prompt": "We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.", "completion": "What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?"}
{"prompt": "Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.", "completion": "You were well adjusted to my being dead?"}
{"prompt": "Give us time.", "completion": "Like hugging a lamp post."}
{"prompt": "I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.", "completion": "What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?", "completion": "Not at all."}
{"prompt": "The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.", "completion": "How do you do?"}
{"prompt": "My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.", "completion": "Some kind of animal?"}
{"prompt": "Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.", "completion": "What do you do for a living?"}
{"prompt": "You are woman.  I know woman well.", "completion": "This is crazy."}
{"prompt": "Daughter--I love you very much.", "completion": "You don't even know me."}
{"prompt": "Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?", "completion": "I'm engaged."}
{"prompt": "What time do you get off work, my child?", "completion": "I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man."}
{"prompt": "Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?"}
{"prompt": "A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.", "completion": "Sir?"}
{"prompt": "I think so, daughter.  How old are you?", "completion": "Eighteen--  and a half."}
{"prompt": "Heaven.", "completion": "Can I help you, sir?"}
{"prompt": "I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.", "completion": "\"Hamburger Heaven.\""}
{"prompt": "For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.", "completion": "How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't."}
{"prompt": "I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.", "completion": "Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do."}
{"prompt": "Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.", "completion": "Leave the rifle here."}
{"prompt": "Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.", "completion": "What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt": "It's trash now, like mine.", "completion": "New lives begin!"}
{"prompt": "Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.", "completion": "Thank you--for my life."}
{"prompt": "Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.", "completion": "Can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Get up.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I've enjoyed being man.", "completion": "No.  No."}
{"prompt": "Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.", "completion": "Don't shoot."}
{"prompt": "If you want to be found that way.", "completion": "What is this thing that kills me?"}
{"prompt": "Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.", "completion": "Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?"}
{"prompt": "New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!", "completion": "Like the saber-toothed tiger."}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man."}
{"prompt": "You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?", "completion": "I'm going to shoot you now."}
{"prompt": "More clowning!  Don't you see?", "completion": "We never quit fighting until we're dead."}
{"prompt": "I'm utterly satisfied.", "completion": "You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me."}
{"prompt": "Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.", "completion": "Here.  Finish the job."}
{"prompt": "But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.", "completion": "Was I ever of use?"}
{"prompt": "I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--", "completion": "You're too modest."}
{"prompt": "And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.", "completion": "The new hero is you."}
{"prompt": "My violin is avenged!", "completion": "Something seems to have happened to my self-respect."}
{"prompt": "You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!", "completion": "Don Quixote."}
{"prompt": "No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.", "completion": "I see."}
{"prompt": "I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.", "completion": "You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?"}
{"prompt": "Poison.", "completion": "You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, \"Is Harold Ryan really a clown?\" And the answer is, \"Yes.\""}
{"prompt": "I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!", "completion": "I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, \"Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete,\" and, \"Clown, clown, clown.\""}

{"prompt": "King Arthur.", "completion": "You hope."}
{"prompt": "You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.", "completion": "I'm an honorable clown?"}
{"prompt": "If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.", "completion": "This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?"}
{"prompt": "Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!", "completion": "I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?"}
{"prompt": "You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.", "completion": "I love you!  Have a cigar!"}
{"prompt": "I'm high as a kite.", "completion": "Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again."}
{"prompt": "And terror, if you don't mind.", "completion": "You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?"}
{"prompt": "Comical?", "completion": "Hands and knees, you say?"}
{"prompt": "Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.", "completion": "I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are."}
{"prompt": "We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.", "completion": "You're a son of a bitch."}
{"prompt": "Now who's being cruel?", "completion": "A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs."}
{"prompt": "Oooooo.  That hurt.", "completion": "You're old--so old."}
{"prompt": "We'll find out now, won't we?", "completion": "You're a filthy, rotten bastard."}

{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?"}

WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.", "completion": "There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?"}
{"prompt": "What brought you back?", "completion": "The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. \"Honor, \" if you like."}
{"prompt": "This is man to man.", "completion": "It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?"}
{"prompt": "There's a certain amount of information there.", "completion": "Lest we forget how cruel you are."}
{"prompt": "It died for your sins.", "completion": "This little corpse is intended as a lesson?"}
{"prompt": "What for?", "completion": "Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye."}

{"prompt": "Gentlemen--that's nice.", "completion": "You startled me."}
{"prompt": "Ooops.", "completion": "Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?"}
{"prompt": "I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.", "completion": "Ooops."}
{"prompt": "So long, you guys.", "completion": "What will you do, Colonel?"}
{"prompt": "And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.", "completion": "I dunno."}
{"prompt": "How horrible.", "completion": "Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?"}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, \"Guess who?\" She conked right out."}
{"prompt": "Who's dead?", "completion": "My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--"}
{"prompt": "For what?", "completion": "For saying \"shit.\" Or is that okay now?"}
{"prompt": "Alice is dead?", "completion": "No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope."}
{"prompt": "Dead!", "completion": "Jesus."}
{"prompt": "She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.", "completion": "So that's it! \"Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum.\" Everybody was yelling \"Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum.\" I thought it was some foreign language."}
{"prompt": "You didn't even find that out?", "completion": "There was so much going on."}
{"prompt": "Alice got married again.", "completion": "She did?"}
{"prompt": "And you went home unannounced, too?", "completion": "I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did."}
{"prompt": "It was a bitch.", "completion": "Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin."}
{"prompt": "I dunno, boy.", "completion": "You don't know?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?", "completion": "Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash."}
{"prompt": "Won't you please join our club? Please?", "completion": "Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink."}
{"prompt": "I'm only ten years old.", "completion": "That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.", "completion": "Thought you were another wife, maybe."}
{"prompt": "Ja?", "completion": "Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace."}
{"prompt": "That is sad.", "completion": "Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things."}
{"prompt": "Premature ejaculation.", "completion": "Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word \"buffalo.\" Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids."}
{"prompt": "Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?", "completion": "Because he was cruel?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?"}
{"prompt": "I heard you were looking for me.", "completion": "You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?"}
{"prompt": "All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.", "completion": "Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?"}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.", "completion": "Don't touch me."}
{"prompt": "I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!", "completion": "I'll kill myself."}
{"prompt": "That goes double for me.", "completion": "I don't want to live any more."}
{"prompt": "Thank God!", "completion": "What a relief!"}
{"prompt": "I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.", "completion": "Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too."}
{"prompt": "Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.", "completion": "Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?"}
{"prompt": "You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.", "completion": "Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here."}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "Don't!"}
{"prompt": "Kid--kid--", "completion": "And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!"}
{"prompt": "I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?", "completion": "She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far."}
{"prompt": "You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?", "completion": "It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?"}
{"prompt": "Something's made you sore.", "completion": "Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?", "completion": "I don't care what she wears."}
{"prompt": "Then get him.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "It is an emergency, isn't it?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "He can hardly talk.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?", "completion": "What does he say to do?"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?", "completion": "What are his symptoms?"}
{"prompt": "It is you, isn't it, Harold?", "completion": "That's why I'm crying."}
{"prompt": "There stands the loins from which you've sprung.", "completion": "I don't get it."}
{"prompt": "That man is your father.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "For Heaven's sakes!", "completion": "Mom?"}
{"prompt": "What's his name?", "completion": "Don't know."}
{"prompt": "Then who flushed the toilet?", "completion": "Father's friend."}
{"prompt": "Is Norbert still here?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Yes, he is.", "completion": "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"}
{"prompt": "Who have you been talking to?", "completion": "What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?"}
{"prompt": "Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.", "completion": "Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?"}
{"prompt": "It's beautiful.", "completion": "Where will you be?"}
{"prompt": "To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.", "completion": "I hate that thing."}
{"prompt": "J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.", "completion": "I don't really know."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know that.", "completion": "A lot of people don't."}
{"prompt": "I was afraid to ask.", "completion": "Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother."}
{"prompt": "How did she lose her feet?", "completion": "In a railroad accident many years ago."}
{"prompt": "Still lives with his mother.", "completion": "You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?"}
{"prompt": "You're the only woman he ever took out.", "completion": "Not true."}
{"prompt": "A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.", "completion": "That's an interesting piece of news."}
{"prompt": "A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.", "completion": "A what kind of doctor?"}
{"prompt": "If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?", "completion": "Thank you, kind sir."}
{"prompt": "He's alive!", "completion": "Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore."}
{"prompt": "You're married!  You've already got a husband!", "completion": "He's a ghost!"}
{"prompt": "Stay home tonight!", "completion": "Oh, Paul--"}
{"prompt": "Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.", "completion": "I told you this was a simple-minded play."}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared."}
{"prompt": "He isn't?", "completion": "He is my father."}
{"prompt": "I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?", "completion": "He isn't any friend of Father."}
{"prompt": "It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.", "completion": "Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"prompt": "I hate that thing.", "completion": "Keeps fairies away!"}
{"prompt": "It's fine!", "completion": "It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about it.", "completion": "How's the fungus around your thumbnail?"}
{"prompt": "My father!", "completion": "I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?"}
{"prompt": "Everything stays as it is!", "completion": "A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat."}
{"prompt": "We don't have a maid any more.", "completion": "Oh?"}
{"prompt": "You're taking Mom out tonight?", "completion": "You're going out?"}
{"prompt": "He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.", "completion": "Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope."}
{"prompt": "Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.", "completion": "You and Harold are friends?"}
{"prompt": "What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.", "completion": "It's true."}
{"prompt": "I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.", "completion": "You were wonderful."}
{"prompt": "You're saying no.", "completion": "I'm saying no--and thank you."}
{"prompt": "Marry me instead.", "completion": "Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League."}
{"prompt": "I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "How long has this been going on?", "completion": "A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--"}
{"prompt": "We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?", "completion": "Possibly."}
{"prompt": "He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.", "completion": "What's the matter now?"}
{"prompt": "He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.", "completion": "What was it?"}
{"prompt": "Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.", "completion": "We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?"}
{"prompt": "They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, \"Happy Birthday, Somebody Else.\"", "completion": "Did you talk to Paul?"}
{"prompt": "For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.", "completion": "How nice."}
{"prompt": "Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.", "completion": "A what?"}
{"prompt": "I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.", "completion": "You figure!"}
{"prompt": "The park!", "completion": "It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!"}
{"prompt": "Is he coming home?", "completion": "He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park."}
{"prompt": "Is he all right?", "completion": "Far as I know."}
{"prompt": "Did you see him?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What then?", "completion": "We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us."}
{"prompt": "Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.", "completion": "Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?"}
{"prompt": "Women are always late.  You'll find out.", "completion": "Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long."}
{"prompt": "Good night.", "completion": "Coming."}
{"prompt": "I see.", "completion": "If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night."}
{"prompt": "I'm touched.", "completion": "That's when I'll get my confidence back."}
{"prompt": "This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.", "completion": "When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "Something happens to my confidence."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.", "completion": "You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, \"My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--\""}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt."}
{"prompt": "I'm glad.", "completion": "I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University."}
{"prompt": "That's something I suppose.", "completion": "All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up."}
{"prompt": "Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.", "completion": "He'd assume we had."}
{"prompt": "Doing what?", "completion": "He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is."}
{"prompt": "I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?", "completion": "I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us."}
{"prompt": "Please--", "completion": "He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom."}
{"prompt": "Do it!", "completion": "Goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Everything's going to be beautiful.", "completion": "You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!"}
{"prompt": "You fool, you fool.", "completion": "Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?"}
{"prompt": "Get out of here.", "completion": "It's really that bad?"}
{"prompt": "Tell her to have a nice trip.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "I believe in miracles now.", "completion": "I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt."}
{"prompt": "How neat.  How keen.", "completion": "Thank you.  Thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "You know each other?", "completion": "We met here earlier this evening."}
{"prompt": "That's been said before.", "completion": "He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged."}
{"prompt": "No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, \"You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight.\"  On that we can build.", "completion": "It's a jungle out there."}
{"prompt": "If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.", "completion": "He's not your son."}
{"prompt": "He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.", "completion": "We've got to rescue him."}
{"prompt": "They didn't murder me.", "completion": "Paul's only twelve years old."}
{"prompt": "Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.", "completion": "And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!"}
{"prompt": "To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--", "completion": "I'm amazed."}
{"prompt": "Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.", "completion": "Why would you do that?"}
{"prompt": "I'd be dead by now if that were the case.", "completion": "Meaning?"}
{"prompt": "I wish Paul luck.", "completion": "It's suicide!"}
{"prompt": "If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.", "completion": "No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more."}
{"prompt": "What kind of a life is that?", "completion": "He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!"}
{"prompt": "The what?", "completion": "It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition."}
{"prompt": "We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?", "completion": "That's the XKE."}
{"prompt": "After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.", "completion": "The only thing I ever told him about life was, \"Keep out of the park after the sun goes down.\""}
{"prompt": "The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.", "completion": "As long as he keeps out of the park."}
{"prompt": "This is very good for us.", "completion": "It is?"}
{"prompt": "I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.", "completion": "Tonight's the night."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you."}
{"prompt": "No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.", "completion": "Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool."}
{"prompt": "Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.", "completion": "\"War is not healthy for children and other living things.\" How lovely."}
{"prompt": "I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?", "completion": "They made her so sleepy she couldn't work."}
{"prompt": "She quit this afternoon.", "completion": "The animals made her sneeze and cry too much."}
{"prompt": "We made the date three months ago.", "completion": "I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact."}
{"prompt": "Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.", "completion": "Take plenty of cigars."}
{"prompt": "I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.", "completion": "Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?"}
{"prompt": "\"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!\"", "completion": "We can take off the \"Wanda June\" with a butter knife."}
{"prompt": "Minors aren't allowed at fights.", "completion": "Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back."}
{"prompt": "What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.", "completion": "I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--"}
{"prompt": "Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.", "completion": "If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--"}
{"prompt": "It's good.  Let him go.", "completion": "If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--"}
{"prompt": "You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!", "completion": "Kid--kid--"}
{"prompt": "He died of a massive rupture.", "completion": "You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow."}
{"prompt": "Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.", "completion": "You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?"}
{"prompt": "You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?", "completion": "Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two."}
{"prompt": "None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.", "completion": "Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind."}
{"prompt": "I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!", "completion": "It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon."}
{"prompt": "Penelope!  We're late!", "completion": "The late Mrs. Harold Ryan."}
{"prompt": "Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.", "completion": "We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive."}
{"prompt": "That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.", "completion": "Phooey."}
{"prompt": "Not true.", "completion": "Or get eaten alive."}
{"prompt": "That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.", "completion": "You've got to fight from time to time."}
{"prompt": "I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.", "completion": "Is that a fact?"}
{"prompt": "You bet! \"The Harold Ryan Fan Club.\" Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, \"Go take a flying--", "completion": "Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in."}
{"prompt": "It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? \"Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.\" Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.", "completion": "We're going to have jackets, aren't we?"}
{"prompt": "Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.", "completion": "Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard."}
{"prompt": "Mozart plays shuffleboard.", "completion": "Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard."}
{"prompt": "We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.", "completion": "Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard."}
{"prompt": "Yes, we do.", "completion": "We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time."}
{"prompt": "You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?", "completion": "We have this new club up here in Heaven."}
{"prompt": "That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.", "completion": "No. I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.", "completion": "I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'"}
{"prompt": "Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.", "completion": "Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come."}
{"prompt": "No, just not the type.", "completion": "What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long."}
{"prompt": "You're not exactly the type we're looking for.", "completion": "You mean I'm black?"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead."}
{"prompt": "There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.", "completion": "I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities."}
{"prompt": "But is she, has...", "completion": "There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway."}
{"prompt": "Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.", "completion": "The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there."}
{"prompt": "We aren't gonna arrest him for that...", "completion": "Big threat. TV would ream you."}
{"prompt": "I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?", "completion": "If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star."}
{"prompt": "Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?", "completion": "You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you..."}
{"prompt": "Wait?", "completion": "Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?"}
{"prompt": "I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?", "completion": "Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting angry.", "completion": "Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks."}
{"prompt": "...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?", "completion": "Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before."}
{"prompt": "I said I just wanted to talk to you...", "completion": "That's cool."}
{"prompt": "I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.", "completion": "Now, what do you want?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it."}
{"prompt": "You want a tip?", "completion": "Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips."}
{"prompt": "No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.", "completion": "Are you going to stiff me?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself."}
{"prompt": "Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.", "completion": "Pull out your cock."}
{"prompt": "No, I don't.", "completion": "I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off."}
{"prompt": "There's a girl I want to ask you about.", "completion": "You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I want to...", "completion": "Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice."}
{"prompt": "You'll be fine.", "completion": "You're still dressed?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. I'll take a half hour.", "completion": "Do you have any particular choice of girl?"}
{"prompt": "I just want to ask some questions.", "completion": "You may do that in the privacy of your room."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Do you want to take a session?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671."}
{"prompt": "The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.", "completion": "'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face."}
{"prompt": "How many weeks?", "completion": "Just one."}
{"prompt": "That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.", "completion": "I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press."}
{"prompt": "Man, how many girls do you need?", "completion": "I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young."}
{"prompt": "My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.", "completion": "That's all you got, three girls?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know no Tod.", "completion": "What girls you got here?"}
{"prompt": "...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.", "completion": "I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?"}
{"prompt": "We offer...", "completion": "Yeah, yeah..."}
{"prompt": "Hello. You want some information?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?", "completion": "Yeah. How did you know?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. I think it'll look better.", "completion": "If you say so."}
{"prompt": "Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.", "completion": "Are you sure it's all right?"}
{"prompt": "Overpowering?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Sam?", "completion": "Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little..."}
{"prompt": "Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.", "completion": "Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.", "completion": "What's that shade of blue called?"}
{"prompt": "No, that would be much too overpowering.", "completion": "Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for."}
{"prompt": "Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...", "completion": "No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall."}
{"prompt": "I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.", "completion": "Don't you think it's a little too... bright?"}
{"prompt": "I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.", "completion": "What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary."}
{"prompt": "Where is he, Niki?", "completion": "Is this all the display space we can get?"}
{"prompt": "Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.", "completion": "But then you'll forget about me."}
{"prompt": "Where is he?", "completion": "I can't tell you that."}
{"prompt": "Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.", "completion": "Did you find out where she was?"}
{"prompt": "My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...", "completion": "Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about..."}
{"prompt": "Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.", "completion": "Granville?"}
{"prompt": "Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.", "completion": "I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes..."}
{"prompt": "She left you right?", "completion": "Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you say that?", "completion": "Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?"}
{"prompt": "What makes you so sure?", "completion": "You wife isn't dead is she?"}
{"prompt": "But what?", "completion": "I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life."}
{"prompt": "On your own land?", "completion": "Look, I really don't know your daughter but..."}
{"prompt": "Do you live in a house back in wherever.", "completion": "Grand Rapids? Of course."}
{"prompt": "I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.", "completion": "They are the same."}
{"prompt": "Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.", "completion": "I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way."}
{"prompt": "Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.", "completion": "Where does he live."}
{"prompt": "Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.", "completion": "Why can't I meet him now?"}
{"prompt": "It's not quite the same thing.", "completion": "It doesn't make any sense to me."}
{"prompt": "I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.", "completion": "If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  Well, mostly.", "completion": "I thought I was fucked up."}
{"prompt": "Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.", "completion": "You really believe all that?"}
{"prompt": "More or less.", "completion": "Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't."}
{"prompt": "He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.", "completion": "So it's already worked out. The fix is in?"}
{"prompt": "I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'", "completion": "Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?"}
{"prompt": "I can stop if you want.", "completion": "No, please go on."}
{"prompt": "Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.", "completion": "Fuck."}
{"prompt": "T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'", "completion": "Shit."}
{"prompt": "It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?", "completion": "Yeah, yeah, go on."}
{"prompt": "They believe in the 'TULIP.'", "completion": "What the crap?"}
{"prompt": "Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.", "completion": "Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation."}
{"prompt": "Is Kristen safe?", "completion": "You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?"}
{"prompt": "What does that mean?  What does he do?", "completion": "He deals in pain."}
{"prompt": "They were here?", "completion": "Tod was.  He was with Ratan."}
{"prompt": "What's T-J?", "completion": "Tijuana."}
{"prompt": "What do you care about?", "completion": "I care about my daughter."}
{"prompt": "We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.", "completion": "I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson."}
{"prompt": "How important do you think sex is?", "completion": "Not very."}
{"prompt": "Neither am I.", "completion": "But it's all you do."}
{"prompt": "Why? Are you a sex fiend?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex."}
{"prompt": "Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.", "completion": "You used to work at Copper Penny?"}
{"prompt": "Is that the way it was with you?", "completion": "No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?", "completion": "Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?", "completion": "You don't understand shit."}
{"prompt": "Say what?", "completion": "'Sucking off.'"}
{"prompt": "You know what I'm talking about.", "completion": "You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?"}
{"prompt": "You won't keep growing at this rate.", "completion": "What rate?"}
{"prompt": "You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.", "completion": "At least I'm a growing person."}
{"prompt": "She's dead.", "completion": "Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days."}
{"prompt": "Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.", "completion": "And your wife? Where's she?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  I'm her father.", "completion": "Jesus."}
{"prompt": "A friend.", "completion": "Of Joanne's?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "Ulcers.", "completion": "You're not a private detective either, are you?"}
{"prompt": "I don't drink, but you can go out.", "completion": "You don't drink?"}
{"prompt": "Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.", "completion": "You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "I thought you were going to bed?", "completion": "I am."}
{"prompt": "Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?", "completion": "This is different. This is nine hundred dollars."}
{"prompt": "Okay. My client pays for it anyway.", "completion": "When do we start?"}
{"prompt": "Half now, half later.", "completion": "Make it nine hundred. That was my best week."}
{"prompt": "I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.", "completion": "Up front?"}
{"prompt": "Three hundred?", "completion": "This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall."}
{"prompt": "Something like that. How much do you make?", "completion": "Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl."}
{"prompt": "How much do you make a week, Niki?", "completion": "Are you a private detective?"}
{"prompt": "If we went there, would you be able to find him?", "completion": "You're not a film producer, are you?"}
{"prompt": "Where's he?", "completion": "Last I heard he went to San Diego."}
{"prompt": "Where is she?", "completion": "Tod might know."}
{"prompt": "Nah.", "completion": "Do you know where she would be?"}
{"prompt": "No. I saw her with Tod.", "completion": "Do you know where she lives?"}
{"prompt": "Joanne?", "completion": "You know her?"}
{"prompt": "Um-hm. Live sound.", "completion": "Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You making a feature?"}
{"prompt": "I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.", "completion": "Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada."}
{"prompt": "Too bad. I wasn't in it.", "completion": "It's your money. You talk."}
{"prompt": "Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.", "completion": "Are you Niki?"}
{"prompt": "She thinks so.  What do you do?", "completion": "I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together."}
{"prompt": "You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.", "completion": "The other girl is the star?"}
{"prompt": "Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.", "completion": "Are you the star of this picture?"}
{"prompt": "But I'm here to help you...", "completion": "Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money..."}
{"prompt": "What happened, pilgrim?", "completion": "Just leave me alone."}
{"prompt": "Does she know anything about this?", "completion": "Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen."}
{"prompt": "It's just a name.", "completion": "Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can."}
{"prompt": "I just heard. Who is he?", "completion": "You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?"}
{"prompt": "Who is Ratan?", "completion": "Where'd you hear that name?"}
{"prompt": "Why don't you tell me something for a change?", "completion": "Like what?"}
{"prompt": "You sure as hell haven't been any help.", "completion": "I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure.", "completion": "Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into."}
{"prompt": "Do the police want to arrest me?", "completion": "Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing here?", "completion": "I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face."}
{"prompt": "But this is my apartment.", "completion": "Get out!"}
{"prompt": "I'm only human, you know.", "completion": "Get out."}
{"prompt": "Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.", "completion": "Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit."}
{"prompt": "I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.", "completion": "Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too."}
{"prompt": "You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.", "completion": "I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why."}
{"prompt": "Do you think she's safe?", "completion": "Yeah. Probably."}
{"prompt": "But the police...", "completion": "The police? They know less than you do."}
{"prompt": "What's it called?", "completion": "It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist."}
{"prompt": "Who made it?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Where did you get that film?", "completion": "I bought it at a store in L.A."}
{"prompt": "Where is she?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Hmm.", "completion": "There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see."}
{"prompt": "They are?", "completion": "Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "They're legal now."}
{"prompt": "That's like a stag film.", "completion": "Yeah. You ever seen any of those?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Do you know what a \"hardcore\" movie is?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?"}
{"prompt": "Where is she?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "What have you found out?", "completion": "I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is."}
{"prompt": "I'll be there.", "completion": "This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all."}
{"prompt": "I've got a meeting...", "completion": "What are you paying me for?"}
{"prompt": "In G.R.? Why?", "completion": "Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?"}
{"prompt": "Where are you? The connection sounds very good.", "completion": "I'm back in Grand Rapids."}
{"prompt": "Mast?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Hello?", "completion": "Mr. Van Dorn?"}
{"prompt": "And better?", "completion": "I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper."}
{"prompt": "Who's paying you?", "completion": "You are."}
{"prompt": "If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.", "completion": "Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them."}
{"prompt": "Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?", "completion": "No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around..."}
{"prompt": "Andy.", "completion": "...What do you have to offer?"}
{"prompt": "Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.", "completion": "So then, Mr. Mast..."}
{"prompt": "Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.", "completion": "Well, what do they know?"}
{"prompt": "What will I tell the others? They care about you.", "completion": "Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them..."}
{"prompt": "What plan?", "completion": "You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me."}
{"prompt": "What is going on?", "completion": "I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone."}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.", "completion": "Just do what I say. Don't ask."}
{"prompt": "Wes, do me a favor.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "How did you find me?", "completion": "I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive."}
{"prompt": "You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.", "completion": "Jake?"}
{"prompt": "How's your business, Jake?", "completion": "Pretty good."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.", "completion": "I'll come with you. Let me pack some things."}
{"prompt": "They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.", "completion": "Is Marsha there?"}
{"prompt": "Wes, Anne, come here a moment.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.", "completion": "What is it, Jake?"}
{"prompt": "You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?", "completion": "No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office."}
{"prompt": "Where!", "completion": "Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest."}
{"prompt": "Where does he hang out?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Where is she? Where is the girl?", "completion": "She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other."}
{"prompt": "I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.", "completion": "Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me."}
{"prompt": "It was called 'Slave of Love.'", "completion": "God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing."}
{"prompt": "That's what I wanted to talk to you about.", "completion": "Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids."}
{"prompt": "That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.", "completion": "Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff."}
{"prompt": "That's not true, Mr...?", "completion": "Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim."}
{"prompt": "We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...", "completion": "I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.", "completion": "Hey man."}
{"prompt": "Ratan!", "completion": "Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "That film was a fake! Everything's phony..."}
{"prompt": "You ain't goin' nowhere alone.", "completion": "Where's Ratan?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know what you're talking about.", "completion": "You wait here. I'll find out where she is."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?", "completion": "I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you."}
{"prompt": "Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "Take it or leave it.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Um-hm. You got the five hundred?", "completion": "Well..."}
{"prompt": "I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.", "completion": "Is this with a girl named Kristen?"}
{"prompt": "Who told you about this?", "completion": "Rucker."}
{"prompt": "You're talking about real excitement?", "completion": "Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know..."}
{"prompt": "What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.", "completion": "I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide."}
{"prompt": "What you got in mind?", "completion": "I want to meet Ratan."}
{"prompt": "Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "That's all right.", "completion": "No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Here. Take your fifty cents back."}
{"prompt": "I don't know nothing, man.", "completion": "You don't want anything for your fifty cents?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.", "completion": "But I..."}
{"prompt": "That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.", "completion": "I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know what you're talking about.", "completion": "I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here."}
{"prompt": "They're all about the same. You want something?", "completion": "This is from the movie I was talking about."}
{"prompt": "What we got is just these here.  What you see.", "completion": "It's a short film."}
{"prompt": "It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.", "completion": "Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'"}
{"prompt": "Fifty cents admission.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Sounds all right.", "completion": "Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary."}
{"prompt": "Jake.", "completion": "...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around."}
{"prompt": "I thought you were a businessman.", "completion": "Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?"}
{"prompt": "It's an investment.", "completion": "If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper."}
{"prompt": "Not exactly...", "completion": "It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?"}
{"prompt": "I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...", "completion": "In other words, you want to get laid?"}
{"prompt": "Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.", "completion": "What exactly do you have in mind?"}
{"prompt": "I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.", "completion": "Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.", "completion": "Film making can be pretty expensive..."}
{"prompt": "No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.", "completion": "My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition."}
{"prompt": "Hold it, mister.", "completion": "What do you think of that? Or this?"}
{"prompt": "Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.", "completion": "Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?"}
{"prompt": "Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?", "completion": "I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?"}
{"prompt": "Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.", "completion": "I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything."}
{"prompt": "Well, a boy goes like this, see.", "completion": "What does that do?"}
{"prompt": "You never heard of that?", "completion": "Com'on, tell me."}
{"prompt": "You ever play Chicken?", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "He asked me. You going with anybody?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "To anybody.", "completion": "You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?"}
{"prompt": "You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.", "completion": "To his own daughter?"}
{"prompt": "I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?", "completion": "Maybe. Maybe not."}
{"prompt": "I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.", "completion": "I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses."}
{"prompt": "He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.", "completion": "I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal."}
{"prompt": "I'm worried about Jake.", "completion": "I'm off that case. He fired me."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me."}
{"prompt": "Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?", "completion": "Ssh. I'm on a stakeout."}
{"prompt": "Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?", "completion": "Jake'll take care of me."}
{"prompt": "You're taking a big chance.", "completion": "I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway."}
{"prompt": "Well, he can just fuck himself.", "completion": "You can fuck off, too."}
{"prompt": "Who's that?", "completion": "The guy who bought you that ring."}
{"prompt": "My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.", "completion": "Granville's looking for you anyway."}
{"prompt": "Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?", "completion": "You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?"}
{"prompt": "No, Andy. Don't know the kid.", "completion": "Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble."}
{"prompt": "At least I improved myself. What's up?", "completion": "I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff."}
{"prompt": "Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?", "completion": "You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.", "completion": "Was he with a girl?"}
{"prompt": "You working in San Diego now?", "completion": "I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around."}
{"prompt": "Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.", "completion": "You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze."}
{"prompt": "Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?", "completion": "I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments."}
{"prompt": "Political Science. It's all about what's going on.", "completion": "He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec."}
{"prompt": "Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.", "completion": "Eh, Poli Sci?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I am.", "completion": "And what are you studying?"}
{"prompt": "How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.", "completion": "You are at the University, Candy?"}
{"prompt": "Lady! Be quiet.", "completion": "Hello, I'm Candy Gulf."}
{"prompt": "Wait here.", "completion": "Because if you are..."}
{"prompt": "Where are the papers?", "completion": "I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?"}
{"prompt": "Then whose name is it registered in?", "completion": "Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?"}
{"prompt": "And that truck - is it registered in your name?", "completion": "Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name."}
{"prompt": "Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?", "completion": "Check."}
{"prompt": "Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...", "completion": "Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job."}
{"prompt": "Possession of a stolen shovel.", "completion": "Officer, I can explain."}
{"prompt": "Is this your shovel?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?", "completion": "We planted it."}
{"prompt": "Out!", "completion": "But there is a family resemblance."}
{"prompt": "None of that, lady.", "completion": "Oh, well. Must have been your brother."}
{"prompt": "Hello.", "completion": "Haven't we met before?"}
{"prompt": "All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.", "completion": "Okay, lady. Out."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.", "completion": "Lady, let me get this straight."}
{"prompt": "Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.", "completion": "Your tree."}
{"prompt": "No, no. I just took it.", "completion": "Took it?"}
{"prompt": "I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?", "completion": "Isn't this your vehicle?"}
{"prompt": "About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.", "completion": "Could I see your registration?"}
{"prompt": "I don't have one. I don't believe in them.", "completion": "How long have you been driving?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I don't have one.", "completion": "Come again."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...", "completion": "Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?"}
{"prompt": "Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...", "completion": "She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed."}
{"prompt": "I'm a file clerk.", "completion": "Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain."}
{"prompt": "I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.", "completion": "Edith was just telling me about her job."}
{"prompt": "Not very.", "completion": "Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?"}
{"prompt": "I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.", "completion": "How interesting."}
{"prompt": "Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.", "completion": "And what do you do, my dear?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.", "completion": "Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?"}
{"prompt": "This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.", "completion": "What kind of a car is it?"}
{"prompt": "Here's your shovel.", "completion": "What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute."}
{"prompt": "What do you see?", "completion": "I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman."}
{"prompt": "A block of ice.", "completion": "Exactly! Now, ask me what I see."}
{"prompt": "Sorry I'm late.", "completion": "A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude."}
{"prompt": "Please, don't you realize? She is dying.", "completion": "Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take."}
{"prompt": "Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.", "completion": "Please! She has got to see a doctor right away."}
{"prompt": "Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!", "completion": "Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more."}
{"prompt": "It's true. I can't live without you.", "completion": "\"And this too shall pass away.\""}
{"prompt": "But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.", "completion": "Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so."}
{"prompt": "I thought eighty was a good round number.", "completion": "I feel giddy."}
{"prompt": "But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.", "completion": "But why now?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.", "completion": "Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die."}
{"prompt": "But you're not going anywhere, are you?", "completion": "Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight."}
{"prompt": "Farewell?", "completion": "Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday."}
{"prompt": "... which I hope will make you very happy.", "completion": "Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Harold.", "completion": "For you."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.", "completion": "It's all right. It's organic."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Harold. You are so young.", "completion": "Supper for two."}
{"prompt": "I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.", "completion": "You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy."}
{"prompt": "Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.", "completion": "You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet."}
{"prompt": "I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.", "completion": "It looks like you. Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate."}
{"prompt": "Why are there no photographs in these frames?", "completion": "I took them out."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Here."}
{"prompt": "- end where I began.", "completion": "Maude."}
{"prompt": "You should have been a poet.", "completion": "Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -"}
{"prompt": "Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.", "completion": "We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely."}
{"prompt": "Do you think there is any life up there?", "completion": "I don't know. Perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Look at the stars.", "completion": "Yes. They're old friends."}
{"prompt": "You sure have a way with people.", "completion": "Well, they're my species."}
{"prompt": "How about some candy floss?", "completion": "Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it."}
{"prompt": "Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.", "completion": "Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience."}
{"prompt": "No. It had nothing on this afternoon.", "completion": "Oh, you weren't scared."}
{"prompt": "She took my head.", "completion": "That wasn't very scary."}
{"prompt": "Just like this.", "completion": "Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs."}
{"prompt": "Don't you advance on me.", "completion": "... of you. You'll all end up like this."}
{"prompt": "Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...", "completion": "Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?"}
{"prompt": "Maude, do you think you can help me?", "completion": "What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something."}
{"prompt": "Really. Just put it there, Harold.", "completion": "They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided."}
{"prompt": "Well, don't go.", "completion": "But they'll put me in jail."}
{"prompt": "But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.", "completion": "But they have."}
{"prompt": "What is it, Harold?", "completion": "They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away."}
{"prompt": "Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...", "completion": "Maude, I must speak to you."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "I've never met her. My mother set it up."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.", "completion": "Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl."}
{"prompt": "From the guys who got the matches, of course.", "completion": "Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful."}
{"prompt": "It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. \"Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can.\"", "completion": "Where's that?"}
{"prompt": "No. I feel more like - yodeling.", "completion": "Yodeling?"}
{"prompt": "Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.", "completion": "Want to join me in some cartwheels?"}
{"prompt": "Well, why don't you?", "completion": "No. I'd feel stupid."}
{"prompt": "With Life.", "completion": "This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults ."}
{"prompt": "Pray? No.  I communicate.", "completion": "With God?"}
{"prompt": "Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.", "completion": "Maude, do you pray?"}
{"prompt": "It's so blue.", "completion": "And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos."}
{"prompt": "I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.", "completion": "Look at that sky.  It's so big."}
{"prompt": "Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an \"L.\" Give me an \"I.\"  Give me a \"V.\" Give me an \"E.\" LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.", "completion": "I like you, Maude."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "How ingenious! Tell me about them.", "completion": "Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?"}
{"prompt": "What was that?", "completion": "Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood."}
{"prompt": "Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. \"The wisest,\" he said, \"the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times.\" Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - \"And this too shall pass away.\"  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.", "completion": "Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times."}
{"prompt": "Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.", "completion": "You are the wisest person I know."}
{"prompt": "Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, \"Don't simply be good. Make good things happen.\"", "completion": "Did Confucius say that?"}
{"prompt": "It's all right.  It's organic.", "completion": "I'm sure picking up on vices."}
{"prompt": "Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?", "completion": "Well, I really don't smoke."}
{"prompt": "Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.", "completion": "I like Glaucus."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Don't you think we should turn off the heat?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. It's almost there.", "completion": "The ice is melting."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.", "completion": "I <u>think</u> I see it."}
{"prompt": "I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.", "completion": "Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly."}
{"prompt": "There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. \"The earth is my body. My head is in the stars.\"  Who said that?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "He's stopped.", "completion": "The old double U-turn. Gets them every time."}
{"prompt": "I think he's following us.", "completion": "Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes."}
{"prompt": "Okay?", "completion": "Superb."}
{"prompt": "But I don't play anything.", "completion": "Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me."}
{"prompt": "Oh come on. I'll teach you.", "completion": "Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?", "completion": "Well, I don't..."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "No more revolts."}
{"prompt": "What were you fighting for?", "completion": "Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government."}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago."}
{"prompt": "Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Oh, it's all right. It's organic.", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?", "completion": "Well, I really don't drink..."}
{"prompt": "Look, the ice is melting.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "It is kind of rough.", "completion": "He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake."}
{"prompt": "What is that he's working on?", "completion": "An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream."}
{"prompt": "He's fallen asleep, as usual.", "completion": "We'll come back in the morning."}
{"prompt": "Oh, my. We're too late.", "completion": "Is he all right?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.", "completion": "Oh, wait, Maude. Look!"}
{"prompt": "Exactly.", "completion": "Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?"}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "But this is public property."}
{"prompt": "We'll transplant it. To the forest.", "completion": "But we can't just dig it up!"}
{"prompt": "Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.", "completion": "But what?"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Over there by the courthouse."}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "Look."}
{"prompt": "The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?", "completion": "Well..."}
{"prompt": "Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.", "completion": "Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages."}
{"prompt": "Because they are all the same.", "completion": "Oooh, but they are not. Look."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Just one of those.", "completion": "Why do you say that?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?"}
{"prompt": "Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?", "completion": "Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?"}
{"prompt": "That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.", "completion": "That's a nice teapot."}
{"prompt": "Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?", "completion": "You don't look eighty."}
{"prompt": "Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.", "completion": "You look as if you could."}
{"prompt": "Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.", "completion": "Certainly a new experience for me."}
{"prompt": "Oh. Eh, I like it.", "completion": "No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it."}
{"prompt": "That's really great.", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>", "completion": "It goes on and on."}
{"prompt": "It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my \"Odorifics.\"", "completion": "Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?"}
{"prompt": "A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled \"Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant.\" Do you like it?", "completion": "Yes. Very much."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the \"Rape of Rome\" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan."}
{"prompt": "Me! No. Of course not.", "completion": "Really. Do you think it's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Do you often model for Glaucus?", "completion": "Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, it's fine. Fine.", "completion": "She seemed yare to me."}
{"prompt": "Eh, fine.", "completion": "I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?"}
{"prompt": "Maude???!", "completion": "How about some ginger pie?"}
{"prompt": "Promise?", "completion": "Harold?"}
{"prompt": "My door is always open.", "completion": "All right."}
{"prompt": "Well, then, you must come back and visit.", "completion": "All right."}
{"prompt": "Oh, at the dentist's?", "completion": "Sort of."}
{"prompt": "Well then.", "completion": "Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it."}
{"prompt": "But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.", "completion": "Thank you, but I really have to go."}
{"prompt": "It's very interesting.", "completion": "Oh, look! The birds."}
{"prompt": "Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...", "completion": "It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean."}
{"prompt": "What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't \"ownership\" a little absurd?", "completion": "Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right."}
{"prompt": "Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.", "completion": "Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?"}
{"prompt": "Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.", "completion": "And you get into any car you want and just drive off?"}
{"prompt": "Yearse!", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "But this is my car.", "completion": "Your hearse?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?"}
{"prompt": "Eh, no.", "completion": "No.  I thought not."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Do you sing and dance?"}
{"prompt": "Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.", "completion": "Do you dance?"}
{"prompt": "Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?", "completion": "No, thank you. I have my car."}
{"prompt": "Nice to meet you.", "completion": "Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Harold Chasen.", "completion": "How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude."}
{"prompt": "Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?", "completion": "Oh, of course. What is your name?"}
{"prompt": "I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.", "completion": "It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak."}
{"prompt": "Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "You're welcome.  Did you know him?", "completion": "Eh, no."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps it is.", "completion": "Eh, no. Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Harold!", "completion": "This is insane."}
{"prompt": "You don't care! \"Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!\" Listen to me...", "completion": "I'm going to marry the woman I love."}
{"prompt": "Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!", "completion": "I don't care what people say."}
{"prompt": "Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?", "completion": "At a funeral."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "A sunflower?"}
{"prompt": "To a girl. Here.", "completion": "I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting married.", "completion": "To whom?"}
{"prompt": "Mother. I'm going to get married.", "completion": "Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?"}
{"prompt": "Mother.", "completion": "Harold, please! I'm on the phone."}
{"prompt": "Mother.", "completion": "Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?"}
{"prompt": "I have a sore throat.", "completion": "Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets..."}
{"prompt": "No. Like this.", "completion": "Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of \"enfluence\" and \"d'argent\" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?"}
{"prompt": "An ancient Japanese ceremony.", "completion": "Like a tea ceremony?"}
{"prompt": "This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.", "completion": "Ohhh. What's hari-kari?"}
{"prompt": "No. My uncle.", "completion": "Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did \"What Price Glory?\" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.", "completion": "Oh, is this your father?"}
{"prompt": "Do you play?", "completion": "No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?"}
{"prompt": "Is Sunshine your real name?", "completion": "Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on \"Sunshine.\" Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here."}
{"prompt": "Would you like a cigarette?", "completion": "No, thank you. They stain my fingers."}
{"prompt": "How do you do?", "completion": "Can't complain."}
{"prompt": "I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.", "completion": "What kind of stuff?"}
{"prompt": "I'd have liked to talk to him.", "completion": "What would you say?"}
{"prompt": "No.  I'd have liked to.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?", "completion": "I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?"}
{"prompt": "We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Then why did you leave?", "completion": "I burnt down the Chemistry building."}
{"prompt": "Your studies?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Your classmates?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "You liked your teachers?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Would you care to talk about this friend?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "None at all?", "completion": "Well, maybe one."}
{"prompt": "You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Harold?", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?", "completion": "I go to funerals."}
{"prompt": "No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.", "completion": "What else do you like?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Is it the machines? The noise? The people?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. What kind of things do you do?", "completion": "I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?", "completion": "You mean when I'm not working on a..."}
{"prompt": "What about the draft?", "completion": "My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Ah, yes.", "completion": "And a lot of time."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "I put a lot of effort into these things."}
{"prompt": "Does that worry you?", "completion": "Yes. It does."}
{"prompt": "No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?", "completion": "I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to."}
{"prompt": "And were they all done for your mother's benefit?", "completion": "I wouldn't say \"benefit.\""}
{"prompt": "Fifteen.", "completion": "A rough estimate."}
{"prompt": "Just give me a rough estimate.", "completion": "Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen."}
{"prompt": "And why is that?", "completion": "Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming..."}
{"prompt": "Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?", "completion": "An accurate number would be difficult to gauge."}
{"prompt": "Stay where you are, Harold .", "completion": "She took my head."}
{"prompt": "Harold, calm down! This is...", "completion": "She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one..."}
{"prompt": "Harold!", "completion": "Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here."}
{"prompt": "Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!", "completion": "Parasite!"}
{"prompt": "What's the chance of getting one of these?", "completion": "Boy, to think I could maybe make my own."}
{"prompt": "Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.", "completion": "Harold!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, how about souvenirs?", "completion": "Souvenirs?"}
{"prompt": "I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.", "completion": "Harold, I think you're getting carried away here."}
{"prompt": "How about to slit his throat?", "completion": "Well, I don't..."}
{"prompt": "To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.", "completion": "Eh?"}
{"prompt": "How about hand-to-hand combat?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!", "completion": "Oh sure."}
{"prompt": "Will they really teach me to shoot?", "completion": "Oh, sure. A variety of weapons."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "ZAT!"}
{"prompt": "The moment of truth.", "completion": "Another man's life in your sights."}
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth."}
{"prompt": "It's the greatest excitement in the world.", "completion": "To pit your own life against another."}
{"prompt": "Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.", "completion": "I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting."}
{"prompt": "Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.", "completion": "You think so, sir?"}
{"prompt": "They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! \"Throw the grenades,\" I shouted. \"Mac, throw the grenades!\" \"He's dead,\" Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. \"Did we hold?\" I asked the medic. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.", "completion": "Jeez! That's a great story,"}
{"prompt": "And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.", "completion": "Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff."}
{"prompt": "Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.", "completion": "War is not all black."}
{"prompt": "Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.", "completion": "During wartime the national suicide rate goes down."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Uncle.", "completion": "Call me \"sir,\" Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect."}
{"prompt": "Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.", "completion": "Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot."}
{"prompt": "Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?", "completion": "Oh yes. That's fine."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's a tricky turn.", "completion": "Eh, yes, ma'm."}
{"prompt": "Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?", "completion": "Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking."}
{"prompt": "Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.", "completion": "But wait..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. How did you like that?", "completion": "Well, I didn't."}
{"prompt": "Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.", "completion": "Were you also the one who painted the statues?"}
{"prompt": "Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Time to play.", "completion": "Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?"}
{"prompt": "Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.", "completion": "No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play."}
{"prompt": "We've always been here.", "completion": "We have no more surprises."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?", "completion": "It's different for us."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I do. I do.", "completion": "Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it."}
{"prompt": "You knew?", "completion": "Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises."}
{"prompt": "Frank.", "completion": "I knew you'd come."}
{"prompt": "Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.", "completion": "Julia."}
{"prompt": "Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!", "completion": "I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty."}
{"prompt": "He... he loved me.", "completion": "Don't waste your tears. Look at him!"}
{"prompt": "No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!", "completion": "'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all."}
{"prompt": "Shit. Bull. Shit.", "completion": "See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank."}
{"prompt": "Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?", "completion": "Yes!"}
{"prompt": "I knew you'd come back.", "completion": "I'm a girl who keeps her promises."}
{"prompt": "I want to go back!", "completion": "Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go."}
{"prompt": "It's coming.", "completion": "It certainly is."}
{"prompt": "She's done it.", "completion": "She certainly has."}
{"prompt": "It's a beautiful dress...", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?", "completion": "No. You look..."}
{"prompt": "I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?", "completion": "Yes... Yes. You look..."}
{"prompt": "O.K. Let's go.", "completion": "Kyle, you don't have..."}
{"prompt": "WHY?", "completion": "Because I'm going to get my father!"}
{"prompt": "Are you crazy?", "completion": "I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. The things you were talking about.", "completion": "Get out of the way."}
{"prompt": "The boxes! I TOLD you.", "completion": "You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got..."}
{"prompt": "The Boxes. In the House. I told you.", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.", "completion": "The box. I need the box."}
{"prompt": "God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.", "completion": "Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?", "completion": "And you're sure it was a woman?"}
{"prompt": "So you slept O.K.?", "completion": "Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on..."}
{"prompt": "If anyone can help, HE can.", "completion": "No bad dreams."}
{"prompt": "I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.", "completion": "Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy."}
{"prompt": "Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!", "completion": "Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I..."}
{"prompt": "I... I had a visitor.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "God, that's terrible.", "completion": "Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with her?", "completion": "Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years."}
{"prompt": "You a doctor, too?", "completion": "Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY."}
{"prompt": "It's been Hell.", "completion": "So... You're Kirsty, huh?"}
{"prompt": "No. Don't let it. You've come this far.", "completion": "Well... G'bye."}
{"prompt": "Finish what?", "completion": "I'm scared."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking...", "completion": "I've got to finish it."}
{"prompt": "You were ALL human!", "completion": "I have to go back. Or it'll never stop."}
{"prompt": "It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!", "completion": "I... remember."}
{"prompt": "No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.", "completion": "Nonsense, I..."}
{"prompt": "Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.", "completion": "What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?"}
{"prompt": "No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.", "completion": "No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information."}
{"prompt": "And what about you?", "completion": "Wait!"}
{"prompt": "I've come for my father!", "completion": "But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours."}
{"prompt": "But I didn't open it! I didn't!", "completion": "Then why are you here?"}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "The Cenobites."}
{"prompt": "Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.", "completion": "I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.", "completion": "The mattress... The mattress... JULIA."}
{"prompt": "He talked about Demons, huh?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "I thought Steve had talked to you?", "completion": "Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap."}
{"prompt": "What are you talking about? Who are you?", "completion": "Oh, excuse me..."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.", "completion": "What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?"}
{"prompt": "You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?", "completion": "Steve..."}
{"prompt": "Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?", "completion": "Where am I?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.", "completion": "They were over here, Professor."}
{"prompt": "The past, the future, whatever this object holds.", "completion": "Is he serious??"}
{"prompt": "I need to touch it to \"see\"...", "completion": "See what??"}
{"prompt": "Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.", "completion": "Oh, right --"}
{"prompt": "Didn't even buy me a drink.", "completion": "Remind me why I keep doing this."}
{"prompt": "I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!", "completion": "Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs."}
{"prompt": "I'm lucky that way.", "completion": "Red. How long was it latched onto you?"}
{"prompt": "No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --", "completion": "You were burned by some organic acid."}
{"prompt": "Red, I found something --", "completion": "Nah -- he's taken care of."}
{"prompt": "Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.", "completion": "Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --"}
{"prompt": "We don't take hints.", "completion": "Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works."}
{"prompt": "How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck", "completion": "Liz left us, Red. Take the hint."}

{"prompt": "Yes. They'll never find us.", "completion": "You can't love him."}
{"prompt": "And the blood let you out?", "completion": "It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?"}
{"prompt": "No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.", "completion": "They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it."}
{"prompt": "You would be. They tore me apart.", "completion": "So you were cheated."}

{"prompt": "Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.", "completion": "Who did?"}
{"prompt": "I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.", "completion": "And you came back here to solve the puzzle --"}
{"prompt": "To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.", "completion": "Hell..."}
{"prompt": "Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.", "completion": "What kind of doors?"}

{"prompt": "This is what began it.", "completion": "A box?"}
{"prompt": "A long time.", "completion": "You promised me an explanation."}
{"prompt": "Not know.", "completion": "Tell me, damn you."}

{"prompt": "That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.", "completion": "Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate."}
{"prompt": "I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.", "completion": "You gotta be kidding me."}
{"prompt": "Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.", "completion": "Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high..."}
{"prompt": "Alison's.", "completion": "Really."}
{"prompt": "Do I know you?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.", "completion": "That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready."}
{"prompt": "Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.", "completion": "I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact."}
{"prompt": "Sonic Death Monkey.", "completion": "What do you think?  Dick likes it."}
{"prompt": "You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?", "completion": "We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey."}
{"prompt": "110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.", "completion": "We're not as bad as you think, Rob."}
{"prompt": "What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.", "completion": "No.  We need the gig."}
{"prompt": "I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.", "completion": "We're getting that anyway."}
{"prompt": "Like fuck you are.", "completion": "Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are."}
{"prompt": "So?  You even said they're good.", "completion": "HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "I heard you, man.  Don't give me that \"what\" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them."}
{"prompt": "Yes way.  It's really...", "completion": "What the fuck is that?"}
{"prompt": "The little skate-fuckers.", "completion": "No way."}
{"prompt": "Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.", "completion": "Not really."}
{"prompt": "Haven't seen it.", "completion": "Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat."}
{"prompt": "I'd want \"One Step Beyond\" by Madness. And \"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\"", "completion": "Because it's in The Big Chill."}
{"prompt": "Whatever.  Okay. \"Tell Laura I Love Her.\" That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.", "completion": "Fuck off, Barry."}
{"prompt": "Ooh.  Drag.", "completion": "It was Jan, and it was a long time after--"}
{"prompt": "What's up?", "completion": "Laura.  Her dad died."}
{"prompt": "So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?", "completion": "Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window."}
{"prompt": "You're not even coming?", "completion": "Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!"}
{"prompt": "How many tickets can I put you down for?", "completion": "None.  Christ!"}
{"prompt": "That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --", "completion": "Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there."}
{"prompt": "That's why you got the gig, isn't it?", "completion": "Isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.", "completion": "They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea."}
{"prompt": "Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?", "completion": "I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments."}
{"prompt": "You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.", "completion": "Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "What band?", "completion": "The band that found me and asked me to join."}
{"prompt": "What the fuck is that?", "completion": "My band."}
{"prompt": "Terrific.", "completion": "Hey."}
{"prompt": "Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.", "completion": "Suck my ass."}
{"prompt": "Shut the fuck up, Barry.", "completion": "Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some."}
{"prompt": "How do you know about that?", "completion": "Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?"}
{"prompt": "Ha.", "completion": "Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all."}
{"prompt": "Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.", "completion": "Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock."}
{"prompt": "Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.", "completion": "I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?"}
{"prompt": "How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.", "completion": "Why would they care?"}
{"prompt": "...But the word \"yet...\" Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.", "completion": "But in your opinion, would I definitely go?"}
{"prompt": "Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?", "completion": "Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone..."}
{"prompt": "Just listen to me.  If I said to you --", "completion": "\"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" yeah, yeah, I hear you --"}
{"prompt": "No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?", "completion": "I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,\" what would you think?", "completion": "I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you."}
{"prompt": "Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? \"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?\"", "completion": "To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century."}
{"prompt": "-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --", "completion": "-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?"}
{"prompt": "Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! \"Let's Get It On?\" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?", "completion": "There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does \"yet\" mean, anyway?  \"I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet.\" What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?", "completion": "Shut up. \"Let's Get It On,\" Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. \"Airbag,\" Radiohead, from OK Computer."}
{"prompt": "Ehh.", "completion": "\"Thunder Road,\" Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" Nirvana, Nevermind."}
{"prompt": "What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?", "completion": "Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... \"Janie Jones,\" the Clash, from The Clash."}
{"prompt": "What are you snickering about?", "completion": "I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "What do you mean, \"what?\""}
{"prompt": "We can take your car.", "completion": "It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great."}
{"prompt": "We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.", "completion": "That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!"}
{"prompt": "What did you tell her about the shop for?", "completion": "I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy."}
{"prompt": "I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.", "completion": "...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes..."}
{"prompt": "But now I kind of like it.", "completion": "I wanna date a musician..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "He offended me with his terrible taste.", "completion": "It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's."}
{"prompt": "Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.", "completion": "What did he ever do to you?"}
{"prompt": "\"Our customers?\" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?", "completion": "Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop."}
{"prompt": "Oh, so what's the point then?", "completion": "I don't want you talking to our customers like that again."}
{"prompt": "We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is \"Don't Drive Drunk.\" I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.", "completion": "Not the point."}
{"prompt": "Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  \"Is it better to burn out than to fade away?\"", "completion": "You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry."}
{"prompt": "Well what's the point in that?", "completion": "Nice, Barry."}
{"prompt": "Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.", "completion": "We'll do it next Monday."}
{"prompt": "Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?", "completion": "Since you brought that bullshit tape in."}
{"prompt": "\"Little Latin Lupe Lu.\"", "completion": "How can it be bullshit to state a preference?"}
{"prompt": "Play it.", "completion": "Say it."}
{"prompt": "Don't you want to hear what's next?", "completion": "What's next?"}
{"prompt": "But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.", "completion": "Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier."}
{"prompt": "Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.", "completion": "I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore."}

{"prompt": "They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.", "completion": "Well what about the new Echo --"}
{"prompt": "Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?", "completion": "They always seemed..."}
{"prompt": "It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --", "completion": "I have all of the others."}
{"prompt": "What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --", "completion": "Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?"}
{"prompt": "Why not?", "completion": "Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells \"I Just Called To Say I Loved You?\" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time."}
{"prompt": "Great.  Can I have it then?", "completion": "No, you can't."}
{"prompt": "I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  \"I Just Called To Say I Love You.\" Do you have it?", "completion": "Oh yeah.  We got it."}
{"prompt": "Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --", "completion": "-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot."}

{"prompt": "What are you talking about?", "completion": "Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all."}

They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them."}

{"prompt": "Is there a difference?", "completion": "OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. \"Sin City\" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home."}

{"prompt": "I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.", "completion": "Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen."}

{"prompt": "It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.", "completion": "Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?"}

In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?", "completion": "C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?"}

I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.", "completion": "Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --"}

{"prompt": "Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.", "completion": "We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?"}

{"prompt": "Can I help you?", "completion": "Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian."}
{"prompt": "I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.", "completion": "It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything."}
{"prompt": "I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.", "completion": "Well, you've asked."}
{"prompt": "Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.", "completion": "I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?"}
{"prompt": "This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.", "completion": "I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will."}

{"prompt": "Fair enough.", "completion": "So?"}
{"prompt": "Are you persuadable?", "completion": "No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Very persuasive."}
{"prompt": "Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?", "completion": "Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?"}

{"prompt": "I mean it.", "completion": "I know."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.", "completion": "Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo."}
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "What are you going to talk to me about?"}
{"prompt": "Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?", "completion": "I'm going to talk to you."}

Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --"}
{"prompt": "Barry?  Barry knows about this?", "completion": "Yeah.  His band is playing a set."}

{"prompt": "And the \"triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?\" \"Triumphant?\" \"Return?\"", "completion": "I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back."}
{"prompt": "WHAT?", "completion": "Just local, of course."}
{"prompt": "Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?", "completion": "Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, \"would be a highly anticipated event, locally.\" He helped me put out a press release."}
{"prompt": "I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.", "completion": "I called Dan Koretzky because he --"}

{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "Wanna go to dinner?"}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "Hi.  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?", "completion": "No use."}
{"prompt": "You're being stupid.", "completion": "How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?"}
{"prompt": "I'm alright.", "completion": "Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?"}
{"prompt": "Harder.", "completion": "Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?"}
{"prompt": "You're tougher.", "completion": "More confident, maybe."}
{"prompt": "And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...", "completion": "I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so."}
{"prompt": "But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?", "completion": "You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs."}
{"prompt": "No, but...", "completion": "But what?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.", "completion": "Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience."}
{"prompt": "But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...", "completion": "How?  How were we the same people?"}
{"prompt": "Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.", "completion": "Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like."}
{"prompt": "Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.", "completion": "I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even."}
{"prompt": "Oh, great...", "completion": "Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?", "completion": "To make you feel better."}
{"prompt": "Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.", "completion": "Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying."}
{"prompt": "Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.", "completion": "Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?"}
{"prompt": "What's the difference?", "completion": "You know the difference."}
{"prompt": "It was like sex.  What else could it be like?", "completion": "Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?"}
{"prompt": "Want to know what, exactly?", "completion": "What it was like."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "C'mon.  I want to know."}
{"prompt": "I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...", "completion": "Let's go home.  Okay?"}
{"prompt": "Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.", "completion": "Mission accomplished."}

{"prompt": "I'm too tired not to go out with you.", "completion": "So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together."}

{"prompt": "I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?", "completion": "Look, we can do other things."}
{"prompt": "No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?", "completion": "Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about."}
{"prompt": "You know, with Ray...", "completion": "Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today."}
{"prompt": "It'll have to be sex, then.", "completion": "Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here."}
{"prompt": "I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.", "completion": "I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "C'mon.", "completion": "When are you going back?"}
{"prompt": "I don't want to go back.", "completion": "What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.", "completion": "Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "You're also an idiot.", "completion": "I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all."}
{"prompt": "You're soaking.", "completion": "Mmnn."}
{"prompt": "Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?", "completion": "Uh... No."}
{"prompt": "Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.", "completion": "Sure.  I'll see you on Friday."}

{"prompt": "Do you want me to be there?", "completion": "I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand."}
{"prompt": "Me?", "completion": "My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to."}
{"prompt": "No, no.  When are you going home?", "completion": "In a minute.  When I get it together."}
{"prompt": "My dad died.  My dad, my dad.", "completion": "I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Pig died.", "completion": "Who the fuck's Pig?"}
{"prompt": "Pigsty.", "completion": "Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better."}
{"prompt": "God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.", "completion": "Are you alright?"}

{"prompt": "Sure they are.", "completion": "They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?

{"prompt": "Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.", "completion": "I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place."}
{"prompt": "That bad, eh?", "completion": "You know what I mean."}
{"prompt": "You still together?  Going all right?", "completion": "I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest."}
{"prompt": "It was kind of funny.", "completion": "I'm sure."}
{"prompt": "Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?", "completion": "He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so."}
{"prompt": "Is that the last of it?", "completion": "Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them."}
{"prompt": "No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.", "completion": "I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.", "completion": "You don't ever think about other people?"}
{"prompt": "Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --", "completion": "I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment."}
{"prompt": "Are you still in love with me?", "completion": "Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later."}
{"prompt": "I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing \"Doctor Who\"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.", "completion": "I'm not -- hold on..."}
{"prompt": "It's me.", "completion": "I figured it was.  Where are you?"}
{"prompt": "You do, huh.", "completion": "Hello."}
{"prompt": "I don't have your number.", "completion": "Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like."}
{"prompt": "Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.", "completion": "Will you call me?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.", "completion": "We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much."}
{"prompt": "You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.", "completion": "And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?"}
{"prompt": "I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.", "completion": "You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? \"Motel Matches?\" \"I Want You?\" \"I Hope You're Happy Now?\" \"Green Shirt?\" His records should be sealed in cases that say \"in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass.\" \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night,\" sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing."}
{"prompt": "I guess.", "completion": "Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?"}
{"prompt": "No, not -- I mean have you, you know --", "completion": "Is that why you wanted to see me?"}
{"prompt": "Have you slept with him yet?", "completion": "I told you I slept with him."}
{"prompt": "Great... That's great.", "completion": "So, how are you?"}
{"prompt": "Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.", "completion": "We'll talk some other time."}
{"prompt": "I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?", "completion": "I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff..."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?"}
{"prompt": "The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.", "completion": "Will you please just go?"}
{"prompt": "But not even before, when he was living upstairs?", "completion": "No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better."}
{"prompt": "Never?", "completion": "I haven't felt like it."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet."}
{"prompt": "Of course it is.", "completion": "You really think it would make a difference either way?"}
{"prompt": "Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?", "completion": "Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?"}
{"prompt": "Is it better?", "completion": "Is what better?  Better than what?"}
{"prompt": "You won't like it.", "completion": "Just ask it!"}
{"prompt": "It sounds stupid.", "completion": "Nevermind."}
{"prompt": "No problem.  If I can ask one question.", "completion": "Fine.  One."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  Great.", "completion": "I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here."}
{"prompt": "Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.", "completion": "Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --", "completion": "-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!"}
{"prompt": "So we have a chance of getting back together again.", "completion": "Oh, Rob, shut up."}
{"prompt": "Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.", "completion": "I suppose so."}
{"prompt": "So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?", "completion": "Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here."}
{"prompt": "Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.", "completion": "I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing."}
{"prompt": "No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?", "completion": "Rob.  Don't be childish."}
{"prompt": "What, what?", "completion": "Did you say something?"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "I guess it's not that obvious, then."}
{"prompt": "Just the obvious stuff.", "completion": "What's the obvious stuff?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.", "completion": "What were the others?"}
{"prompt": "Good.  So.  Is it my job?", "completion": "What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob."}
{"prompt": "Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?", "completion": "I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know."}
{"prompt": "So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?", "completion": "I think you know that."}
{"prompt": "Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?", "completion": "Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?"}
{"prompt": "And do you like it that way?", "completion": "Not really."}
{"prompt": "You really believe that?", "completion": "Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?", "completion": "But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything."}
{"prompt": "Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.", "completion": "So you weren't interested in music at all?"}
{"prompt": "I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.", "completion": "You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- \"It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection.\""}
{"prompt": "Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.", "completion": "But don't you remember?"}
{"prompt": "-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?", "completion": "Hey!  Marvin Gaye! \"Got to Give It Up!\" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!"}
{"prompt": "-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --", "completion": "-- Alright, alright but --"}
{"prompt": "It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --", "completion": "-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --"}
{"prompt": "My house?", "completion": "How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians."}
{"prompt": "Are you coming home?", "completion": "Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "I thought I could give you a lift back."}
{"prompt": "Shit!", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "Jeez.  He goes on long enough.", "completion": "I should be so lucky."}
{"prompt": "We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...", "completion": "Well stay for tonight, then."}
{"prompt": "If by \"we\" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.", "completion": "You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?", "completion": "Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?"}
{"prompt": "Enough of what?", "completion": "I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?"}
{"prompt": "Isn't that how it is for everybody?", "completion": "Enough, Liz."}
{"prompt": "Is Ray going?", "completion": "No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story."}
{"prompt": "You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.", "completion": "What difference does it make?"}
{"prompt": "So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?", "completion": "It's a crematorium."}
{"prompt": "Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were \"kind of looking around for somebody else!\"", "completion": "Well she --"}
{"prompt": "To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!", "completion": "It's true!"}
{"prompt": "What's the -- hey, Liz --", "completion": "-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE."}
{"prompt": "Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, \"you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be.\" You know?", "completion": "Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.", "completion": "How're you holding up?"}
{"prompt": "What's happenin'.", "completion": "You called this morning?"}
{"prompt": "Rob here.", "completion": "Hey.  It's Liz."}
{"prompt": "I'll call you.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "That way.", "completion": "And so it is.  I'll talk to you later."}
{"prompt": "Which way are you going?", "completion": "That way.  You?"}
{"prompt": "Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?", "completion": "God, you ask a lot of questions."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.", "completion": "So you'll stay?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, right.  Alright.", "completion": "Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz."}
{"prompt": "When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.", "completion": "I'd like it if you could stay the night."}
{"prompt": "Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.", "completion": "I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'."}
{"prompt": "Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?", "completion": "Whiskey."}
{"prompt": "For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.", "completion": "I'm sure it isn't."}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?", "completion": "Yes.  You?"}
{"prompt": "You haven't even seen it!", "completion": "Nor have you!"}
{"prompt": "The Conformist.", "completion": "Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!"}
{"prompt": "Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.", "completion": "Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.", "completion": "Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks."}
{"prompt": "Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...", "completion": "Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --"}
{"prompt": "No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.", "completion": "I understand completely."}
{"prompt": "Yup.", "completion": "You share a place with T-Bone?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?"}
{"prompt": "God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song \"Patsy Cline Times Two\" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.", "completion": "It's a great song."}
{"prompt": "Everything go alright?", "completion": "She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually."}
{"prompt": "No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.", "completion": "Hi, Marie."}
{"prompt": "Yup.  Not far from here, actually.", "completion": "Don't you like that?"}
{"prompt": "Good.", "completion": "So you live in Chicago now?"}
{"prompt": "Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.", "completion": "Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself."}
{"prompt": "So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.", "completion": "Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now."}
{"prompt": "What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?", "completion": "It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at."}
{"prompt": "I knew this was going to happen.", "completion": "Then what are you getting so upset about?"}
{"prompt": "And after that?", "completion": "Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out."}
{"prompt": "I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?", "completion": "I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work."}
{"prompt": "You know that's not what's upsetting me.", "completion": "Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Hello?  Anybody there?", "completion": "I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you."}
{"prompt": "Well call her mother.", "completion": "She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno..."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?  Where did she go?", "completion": "How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out."}
{"prompt": "Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...", "completion": "She left.  She's gone."}
{"prompt": "How's the store?", "completion": "So so.  Up and down."}
{"prompt": "Everything all right?", "completion": "Great.  Super-fantastic."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.", "completion": "Hi, Mom."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.  Ten cents.", "completion": "Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?"}
{"prompt": "With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.", "completion": "I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else."}
{"prompt": "Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.", "completion": "And I won't take a penny over ninety."}
{"prompt": "Thirteen hundred.", "completion": "Seventy-five."}
{"prompt": "That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.", "completion": "Sixty."}
{"prompt": "Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.", "completion": "Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will."}
{"prompt": "Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.", "completion": "That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair."}
{"prompt": "It must have taken him a long time to get them together.", "completion": "Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement."}
{"prompt": "And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?", "completion": "He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall."}
{"prompt": "But you must have --", "completion": "I must have nothing.  Their my husband's."}
{"prompt": "These are worth at least, I don't know --", "completion": "I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out."}
{"prompt": "It's the best collection I've ever seen.", "completion": "Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours."}
{"prompt": "What's the name of your label?", "completion": "What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.", "completion": "Nice."}
{"prompt": "I'm Vince.", "completion": "Whatever."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.", "completion": "We're not there yet, Justin."}
{"prompt": "Fuck off.", "completion": "It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys."}
{"prompt": "Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the \"mothers,\" as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.", "completion": "Records are those big round black things, right?"}
{"prompt": "Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.", "completion": "No, we..."}
{"prompt": "Well we don't.", "completion": "I can't frisk you but the cops can."}

{"prompt": "I warned you.", "completion": "Go to hell."}
{"prompt": "Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.", "completion": "Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "He'd want to know about all this."}
{"prompt": "Find the father.  That should clear things up.", "completion": "Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?"}
{"prompt": "How old is Richard?", "completion": "P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30."}
{"prompt": "Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.", "completion": "Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek."}
{"prompt": "Maybe he's hiding from something.", "completion": "Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway."}
{"prompt": "It's in good condition.", "completion": "I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop."}
{"prompt": "Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.", "completion": "You're the expert."}
{"prompt": "Claymore.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Didn't think it was my buddy over there.", "completion": "Figured you knew more about swords than I did."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Didn't look like it came from \"Toys-Are-Us\", that's why I called you."}
{"prompt": "This one came unassembled.", "completion": "How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "Doesn't have a head, does he?"}
{"prompt": "It's my birthday.", "completion": "Happy birthday."}
{"prompt": "There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.", "completion": "You're very macabre."}
{"prompt": "Carl Smith.", "completion": "That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful."}
{"prompt": "There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.", "completion": "Would you remember his name?"}
{"prompt": "Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.", "completion": "Have you spoken to anyone else about this?"}
{"prompt": "Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.", "completion": "The boy _died_?"}
{"prompt": "Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.", "completion": "I don't follow you."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies."}
{"prompt": "Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.", "completion": "Then you didn't know Richard later on."}
{"prompt": "He was unsual.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Would you like more tea?", "completion": "No thank you, I'm fine."}
{"prompt": "Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?", "completion": "Anything in Maryland is close."}
{"prompt": "You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.", "completion": "Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia."}

{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "This is against the rules."}
{"prompt": "Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.", "completion": "It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?"}
{"prompt": "Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.", "completion": "You have lived forever."}
{"prompt": "The inheritance.", "completion": "Not power.  Not control."}
{"prompt": "I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...", "completion": "The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?"}
{"prompt": "Get out.", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!"}
{"prompt": "What's wrong?", "completion": "I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!"}
{"prompt": "Will I see you again?", "completion": "Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to."}
{"prompt": "All of it finished.", "completion": "Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall."}
{"prompt": "It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.", "completion": "What is it you want?"}
{"prompt": "Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.", "completion": "But you're known so much. History I'll only read about."}
{"prompt": "Damn you.", "completion": "What is it like?  Being you?"}
{"prompt": "Don't.", "completion": "Come here, Brenna."}
{"prompt": "I haven't killed _you_.", "completion": "Is that a threat?"}
{"prompt": "There are differences.", "completion": "You kill with your left hand?"}
{"prompt": "Sometimes innocents become involved.", "completion": "You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between."}
{"prompt": "Not the same.", "completion": "What about that family in '31?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't kill the watchman.", "completion": "You killed those other two."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.", "completion": "Of bodies."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.", "completion": "That's insane."}
{"prompt": "He is older than I.", "completion": "What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "He knows about you."}
{"prompt": "I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.", "completion": "That's why Smith called you MacLeod."}
{"prompt": "That would be difficult to explain.", "completion": "I'd like you to try."}
{"prompt": "Just a little crazy.", "completion": "Who are you?"}
{"prompt": "My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.", "completion": "You are a very perceptive young woman."}
{"prompt": "I'm not even sure why.", "completion": "Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer."}
{"prompt": "I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.", "completion": "I see."}
{"prompt": "I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.", "completion": "Why are you here?"}
{"prompt": "I hope I never get that old.", "completion": "You won't."}
{"prompt": "It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.", "completion": "A factor of age."}
{"prompt": "At least.", "completion": "That's impossible."}
{"prompt": "No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.", "completion": "Then you must be at least 70 years old."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "You're using your son's name."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "And you are William Taupin, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Follow me.", "completion": "William Taupin seems to have left his mark."}
{"prompt": "A little dusty.", "completion": "I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself."}
{"prompt": "Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.", "completion": "It's beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Maybe it would do us both good.", "completion": "There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing."}
{"prompt": "They do it each year.", "completion": "I thought it might be a nice break from all of this."}
{"prompt": "Well, as long as we're stuck here.", "completion": "It's some sort of party the town is throwing."}
{"prompt": "No.  So what now?  We just wait?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.", "completion": "It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I wish I could."}
{"prompt": "The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.", "completion": "There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?"}
{"prompt": "The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.", "completion": "You want me to front for you."}
{"prompt": "I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.", "completion": "You make it all sound so simple."}
{"prompt": "Not all of them.", "completion": "When you finish, what then?"}
{"prompt": "Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.", "completion": "You did kill those men."}
{"prompt": "You are.  Now.", "completion": "What's all that?"}
{"prompt": "You've been listening to rumors.", "completion": "Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder."}
{"prompt": "Maybe.", "completion": "Is this what you killed them with?"}
{"prompt": "You're wrong.", "completion": "You're a fool."}
{"prompt": "No.  I had to talk to you.", "completion": "You had to do _nothing_!"}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "No one knows you're here?"}
{"prompt": "He sees me as a threat.", "completion": "Are you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.", "completion": "Go home."}
{"prompt": "I'd rather hear yours.", "completion": "You are being foolish."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story."}
{"prompt": "I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.", "completion": "Have you gone to the police?"}
{"prompt": "What about me?", "completion": "You?"}
{"prompt": "He was innocent.", "completion": "He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now."}
{"prompt": "I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?", "completion": "That bothers you?"}
{"prompt": "He called you \"MacLeod\".", "completion": "Not your concern."}
{"prompt": "What will you do now?", "completion": "You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time."}
{"prompt": "At the moment?  Carl Smith.", "completion": "And you?"}
{"prompt": "Dupont Circle.", "completion": "Who is he?"}
{"prompt": "He tried to kill me last night.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "Tradition.", "completion": "What the hell is going on?"}
{"prompt": "You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.", "completion": "Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.", "completion": "I have friends."}
{"prompt": "You have an active imagination.", "completion": "I've been to Church Hill."}
{"prompt": "I don't know what you're talking about.", "completion": "I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that."}
{"prompt": "People like that rarely leave business cards.", "completion": "Does Carl Smith?"}
{"prompt": "Probably.", "completion": "Who?"}
{"prompt": "Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?", "completion": "Grave robbers?"}
{"prompt": "Good day, Miss Cartwright.", "completion": "Someone beat you."}
{"prompt": "-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-", "completion": "Good reflexes."}
{"prompt": "Basil the II.", "completion": "Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-"}
{"prompt": "Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.", "completion": "Byzantine?"}
{"prompt": "It's not mine.", "completion": "It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years."}
{"prompt": "Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?", "completion": "I'd like to ask you about the claymore."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Very traditional."}
{"prompt": "Call your mother.  You never call her.", "completion": "Do you play?"}
{"prompt": "Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Now there's a new topic.", "completion": "Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?"}
{"prompt": "You're never \"just curious\".  You've met my neice, Brenna.", "completion": "Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school."}
{"prompt": "Forget it.", "completion": "I'm just curious."}
{"prompt": "Never take up poker, Detective.", "completion": "Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's."}
{"prompt": "Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.", "completion": "I have witnesses that can put the two of you together."}
{"prompt": "What's all of this got to do with me?", "completion": "What were you doing in Felton?"}
{"prompt": "What makes you so sure he's the one?", "completion": "Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year."}
{"prompt": "You're an asshole, Moran.", "completion": "I want Taupin."}
{"prompt": "It'll never stick.", "completion": "But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that."}
{"prompt": "What are you getting at, Moran?", "completion": "You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder."}
{"prompt": "Spare me the details.", "completion": "But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin."}
{"prompt": "Four?", "completion": "All fashionably without heads."}
{"prompt": "We've got nothing to say.", "completion": "What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?"}
{"prompt": "I'm calling an attorney.", "completion": "You and I should talk first."}
{"prompt": "What do you want from me?", "completion": "Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons."}
{"prompt": "You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.", "completion": "I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right."}
{"prompt": "Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.", "completion": "A murder."}
{"prompt": "You always were hard to impress.", "completion": "Who is it?"}
{"prompt": "I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.", "completion": "It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it."}
{"prompt": "Good way to lose your job.", "completion": "Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do."}
{"prompt": "It's that important?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.", "completion": "Corey, you _owe_ me."}
{"prompt": "All I need is for you to check the name.", "completion": "You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him."}
{"prompt": "Give it a rest Ned, huh?", "completion": "Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it."}
{"prompt": "Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.", "completion": "You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?"}
{"prompt": "Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.", "completion": "I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it."}
{"prompt": "Stop!", "completion": "I don't believe him."}
{"prompt": "Stop.", "completion": "-In nomine sanctus esperitu-"}
{"prompt": "Be quiet.", "completion": "-Auditorium nostrum-"}
{"prompt": "You'll not be bringing the church into this.", "completion": "-Luceat ei-"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing man?", "completion": "-Et lux perpetua-"}
{"prompt": "I'll be back when I can.", "completion": "Requiem acer'nam donaei-"}
{"prompt": "With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.", "completion": "Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company."}
{"prompt": "You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.", "completion": "That is not me."}
{"prompt": "You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.", "completion": "I am not ready for this."}
{"prompt": "This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.", "completion": "And you?"}
{"prompt": "You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.", "completion": "But why be so concerned about me?"}
{"prompt": "It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.", "completion": "I feel hardly nothing."}
{"prompt": "As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.", "completion": "I do not think I like the sound of that."}
{"prompt": "What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.", "completion": "All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that."}
{"prompt": "You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.", "completion": "Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod."}
{"prompt": "The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.", "completion": "If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed."}
{"prompt": "You have a gift.  One you must protect.", "completion": "And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?"}
{"prompt": "It will take less effort as you learn.", "completion": "It's like to kill me first."}
{"prompt": "Impotent cow.", "completion": "Muy Bien!"}
{"prompt": "Go to hell.", "completion": "Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm."}
{"prompt": "Again.  Try again.", "completion": "Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!"}
{"prompt": "Harder.  Concentrate harder.", "completion": "Me arm hurts."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts."}
{"prompt": "How can I stop such a man?", "completion": "Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help."}
{"prompt": "But we cannot be killed.", "completion": "There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end."}
{"prompt": "Aye.", "completion": "It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all."}
{"prompt": "Why does he want to kill me?", "completion": "You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?"}
{"prompt": "You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.", "completion": "Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost."}
{"prompt": "You will live.  Survive.", "completion": "Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment."}
{"prompt": "You'd have to die first.  Aqui.", "completion": "What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?"}
{"prompt": "You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.", "completion": "This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity."}
{"prompt": "Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.", "completion": "This can't be."}
{"prompt": "It is the truth.", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "Listen to me.  Hear the words.", "completion": "This is madness!"}
{"prompt": "It is as you are.", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "We are immortal."}
{"prompt": "Not even a single lifetime.", "completion": "Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed."}
{"prompt": "You are still so very young.", "completion": "I'm twenty-two."}
{"prompt": "Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.", "completion": "I don't understand."}
{"prompt": "We are brothers.", "completion": "He told me there could be only one."}
{"prompt": "You feel you know me.", "completion": "I don't know why."}
{"prompt": "Does it change with me in the room?", "completion": "It is less."}
{"prompt": "Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?", "completion": "Yes.  Always."}
{"prompt": "When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.", "completion": "You are the same?"}
{"prompt": "You know me home.  Me name.", "completion": "It was time for our paths to cross."}
{"prompt": "You're a long way from Inverness.", "completion": "In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth."}
{"prompt": "Why are you here?", "completion": "I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal."}
{"prompt": "Pheasant.", "completion": "You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic."}
{"prompt": "First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.", "completion": "Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?"}
{"prompt": "And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.", "completion": "How can you know this?"}
{"prompt": "I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.", "completion": "I was driven out."}
{"prompt": "And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?", "completion": "Aye."}
{"prompt": "But you lived.", "completion": "I did at that."}
{"prompt": "Your marks would suggest great injury.", "completion": "I was nearly killed."}
{"prompt": "Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?", "completion": "Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member."}
{"prompt": "I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.", "completion": "Please go to no trouble."}
{"prompt": "You're not from these parts.", "completion": "I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time."}
{"prompt": "Aye.", "completion": "Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon.", "completion": "Your name is Conor?"}
{"prompt": "If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.", "completion": "Do what you must."}
{"prompt": "Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.", "completion": "You're not talking sense, Mara!"}
{"prompt": "Please not be touching me, Conor.", "completion": "I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you."}
{"prompt": "You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.", "completion": "Me father has taken back my hand."}
{"prompt": "That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?", "completion": "I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic."}
{"prompt": "So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.", "completion": "Some think not."}
{"prompt": "But I did live.", "completion": "Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel."}
{"prompt": "What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.", "completion": "You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived."}
{"prompt": "I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.", "completion": "My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands."}
{"prompt": "I'm your future husband, remember?", "completion": "I have no future husband."}
{"prompt": "David.", "completion": "Do you have cause to bothering us?"}
{"prompt": "Far away.", "completion": "Kiss me."}
{"prompt": "Like you.", "completion": "That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?"}
{"prompt": "What would you like?", "completion": "Something pretty."}
{"prompt": "So sure?", "completion": "Oh please.  Another one."}
{"prompt": "Finish yours?", "completion": "Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you."}
{"prompt": "Romirez is dust.", "completion": "Finish your prayers?"}
{"prompt": "I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.", "completion": "Romirez understood.  Not you."}
{"prompt": "You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.", "completion": "You're wrong."}
{"prompt": "Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.", "completion": "No doubt."}
{"prompt": "It's all we have.", "completion": "Not so scared."}
{"prompt": "State of grace and all that.", "completion": "Tradition."}
{"prompt": "Who am I deceiving?", "completion": "Certainly not me."}
{"prompt": "Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.", "completion": "Not likely."}
{"prompt": "We need more time.", "completion": "Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion."}
{"prompt": "They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.", "completion": "I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us."}
{"prompt": "I had no choice.", "completion": "Complete your inspection?"}
{"prompt": "Either you are with me or against me.", "completion": "You see Major?  You are not so different..."}
{"prompt": "Do not turn your back on me.", "completion": "You are really going to force this, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "Don't threaten me, Private.", "completion": "Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  \"Threaten you\"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for."}
{"prompt": "We must talk.", "completion": "Stay out of it."}
{"prompt": "It can be different.  It must be.", "completion": "It never changes, Major."}
{"prompt": "Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.", "completion": "Help?  I've seen others \"help\". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter."}
{"prompt": "Wait.  I think we understand each other.", "completion": "We have no understanding."}
{"prompt": "Equals?", "completion": "If you wish to play games, Major."}
{"prompt": "I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.", "completion": "Excuse me, \"sir\".  I thought we spoke as equals."}
{"prompt": "I understand you joined up in Bremen.", "completion": "You seem to understand a great deal."}
{"prompt": "What is your position?", "completion": "Second musketeer."}
{"prompt": "I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.", "completion": "Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking."}
{"prompt": "Your name?", "completion": "Mulet."}
{"prompt": "But Ian, he's still but a boy.", "completion": "He's a MacLeod."}
{"prompt": "Must he go?", "completion": "Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours."}
{"prompt": "Have you time for some- thing to eat?", "completion": "Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke."}
{"prompt": "Yes, he was.", "completion": "Ah, Conor, how you look a man."}
{"prompt": "My father taught me.", "completion": "Your father must be smart."}
{"prompt": "Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.", "completion": "Where did you learn that?"}
{"prompt": "Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?", "completion": "No.  I want this to be all ours."}
{"prompt": "Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.", "completion": "Round up who you can and put them on standby."}
{"prompt": "You'd think he'd had practice.", "completion": "Are you sure?"}
{"prompt": "Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.", "completion": "Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink."}
{"prompt": "We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.", "completion": "Any other I.D.s come up?"}
{"prompt": "Figure she's with him?", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...", "completion": "I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff."}
{"prompt": "None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...", "completion": "_Answer_ me."}
{"prompt": "He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.", "completion": "He knows I'm here.  How?"}
{"prompt": "The last four.", "completion": "And the Bulgarian?"}
{"prompt": "Smith.  Carl Smith.", "completion": "How many came?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "What name is he using?"}
{"prompt": "You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.", "completion": "Where!"}
{"prompt": "The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.", "completion": "You're wrong."}
{"prompt": "Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.", "completion": "I've had a few more concerns."}
{"prompt": "No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.", "completion": "How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?"}
{"prompt": "I knew his great-grandfather.", "completion": "You're insane."}
{"prompt": "I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.", "completion": "You were never a kid."}
{"prompt": "I haven't drunk this much since-", "completion": "-Since you last saw me."}
{"prompt": "He found us even there.", "completion": "He always did."}
{"prompt": "Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.", "completion": "Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now."}
{"prompt": "But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?", "completion": "Offered the Pope one of his whores."}
{"prompt": "I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his \"heretic stronghold\" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.", "completion": "Neuvich, the clown of the crusades."}
{"prompt": "Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.", "completion": "It's good to see you, Kahn."}
{"prompt": "It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.", "completion": "And have you something to settle with me?"}
{"prompt": "Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.", "completion": "What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "How did you find me?", "completion": "How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?"}
{"prompt": "How are you?", "completion": "Head still secure to the neck."}
{"prompt": "Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?", "completion": "Sit."}
{"prompt": "Spare a chair?", "completion": "Kahn?"}
{"prompt": "Leave her alone.", "completion": "Get up."}
{"prompt": "Go to hell.", "completion": "Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play."}
{"prompt": "Tradition.", "completion": "It's all we have."}
{"prompt": "What's the point!  You have me, finish it!", "completion": "I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy."}
{"prompt": "What's the point?", "completion": "This isn't done.  Get up."}
{"prompt": "Leave her out of this.", "completion": "As you wish."}
{"prompt": "MACLEOD!", "completion": "You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing."}
{"prompt": "I do hope she enjoys a good show.", "completion": "Run!"}
{"prompt": "Friend of yours?", "completion": "Of sorts."}
{"prompt": "You've been here from the start.", "completion": "My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent."}
{"prompt": "Long time.", "completion": "Not so long."}
{"prompt": "Yes laddie, I have her.", "completion": "Should I care?"}
{"prompt": "And if I refuse?", "completion": "Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head."}
{"prompt": "Are you here?", "completion": "I want you to come to me."}
{"prompt": "I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.", "completion": "We have some unfinished business."}
{"prompt": "Do you?", "completion": "All I need is time."}
{"prompt": "He's mistaken.", "completion": "Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea."}
{"prompt": "Home.", "completion": "A neighbor saw your car leave."}
{"prompt": "My condolences.", "completion": "Where were you Tuesday night?"}
{"prompt": "A mystery.", "completion": "For the moment."}
{"prompt": "Your murder weapon?", "completion": "It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood."}
{"prompt": "I presume it's a sword.", "completion": "A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?"}
{"prompt": "You're wrong.", "completion": "Do you know what this is?"}
{"prompt": "What were _you_ looking for?", "completion": "That's none of your business."}
{"prompt": "What are you getting at?", "completion": "Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street."}
{"prompt": "American.", "completion": "Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?"}
{"prompt": "He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.", "completion": "Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?"}
{"prompt": "His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.", "completion": "It doesn't."}
{"prompt": "Did you know the victim?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?", "completion": "I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after."}
{"prompt": "This your present address?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "But I had heard his wounds were mortal.", "completion": "They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever."}
{"prompt": "I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.", "completion": "Steven, Conor didn't die."}
{"prompt": "I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.", "completion": "You're a kind man to be sure."}
{"prompt": "Just your pappy scared some.", "completion": "Ah Steven, it is good to see you."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure that's true.", "completion": "Nothing to be sorry about."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing."}
{"prompt": "Same.", "completion": "Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now."}
{"prompt": "I'll send them right up.", "completion": "Morning Mr. North"}
{"prompt": "The resemblance is amazing.", "completion": "When may I expect the cleaners?"}
{"prompt": "Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.", "completion": "We were very close."}
{"prompt": "You're one of William's kids, huh?", "completion": "His only kid."}
{"prompt": "The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?", "completion": "Oh yes, more than enough."}
{"prompt": "And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.", "completion": "When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up."}
{"prompt": "Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.", "completion": "The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty."}
{"prompt": "This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.", "completion": "A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?", "completion": "Why don't you fellows get your own news?"}
{"prompt": "Bensinger -- of the Tribune.", "completion": "Open this door!"}
{"prompt": "What's the idea of locking this?", "completion": "That's Bensinger. That's his desk."}
{"prompt": "Well, congratulations! Good luck!", "completion": "Who is it?"}
{"prompt": "What doing?", "completion": "I'm getting married tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Are you back?", "completion": "No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself."}
{"prompt": "Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?", "completion": "Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "Au revoir, mon capitaine.", "completion": "Bon jour!"}
{"prompt": "It doesn't have to rhyme!", "completion": "I'll keep you in mind."}
{"prompt": "Exactly!", "completion": "I got my rhyming dictionary in --"}
{"prompt": "Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!", "completion": "Sort of a Jack London style?"}
{"prompt": "Seventy-five.", "completion": "I'll give you a hundred and a by- line."}
{"prompt": "No. Roy. Roy V.", "completion": "Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Remember the ending?  \" -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears...\"", "completion": "Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?", "completion": "The poem?... The poem was great!"}
{"prompt": "Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.", "completion": "I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning."}
{"prompt": "How do you mean?", "completion": "I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Bensinger.", "completion": "Excuse me, I just want to --"}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here."}
{"prompt": "You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.", "completion": "I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. Here it is.", "completion": "Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars."}
{"prompt": "No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.", "completion": "Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars."}
{"prompt": "Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.", "completion": "Did you give her the money?"}
{"prompt": "Out some place.", "completion": "Hildy! Where's mother?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, she was here.", "completion": "Where'd she go?"}
{"prompt": "I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.", "completion": "Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!"}
{"prompt": "I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!", "completion": "We'll explain the whole thing to them."}
{"prompt": "Not through any help of yours, Hildy.", "completion": "Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --"}
{"prompt": "Hello, Bruce...", "completion": "BRUCE!! How'd you get out?"}
{"prompt": "Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.", "completion": "Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.", "completion": "But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --"}
{"prompt": "Did you finish the interview?", "completion": "The Criminal Courts Building."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.", "completion": "Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!"}
{"prompt": "For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.", "completion": "Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?"}
{"prompt": "I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.", "completion": "I'm sure you haven't any."}
{"prompt": "That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.", "completion": "Yes, wasn't it?"}
{"prompt": "I lost my wallet.", "completion": "The check, Bruce!"}
{"prompt": "Fine. And here's a kiss for you.", "completion": "What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.", "completion": "All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?"}
{"prompt": "I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.", "completion": "Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?"}
{"prompt": "I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.", "completion": "All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey."}
{"prompt": "Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --", "completion": "But I don't gamble, Hilda!"}
{"prompt": "On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.", "completion": "But --"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?", "completion": "The five hundred? Sure."}
{"prompt": "Better make that a certified check, Walter.", "completion": "All right, dear."}
{"prompt": "I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.", "completion": "About twenty-five hundred dollars."}
{"prompt": "But --", "completion": "According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?"}
{"prompt": "Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.", "completion": "And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?"}
{"prompt": "I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!", "completion": "Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?"}
{"prompt": "Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?", "completion": "He certainly -- hic -- does!"}
{"prompt": "Too hot?", "completion": "No. It's strong.  But I like it that way."}
{"prompt": "If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.", "completion": "That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor."}
{"prompt": "Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.", "completion": "He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake."}
{"prompt": "You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.", "completion": "You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is."}
{"prompt": "Oh, it isn't like that.", "completion": "It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train."}
{"prompt": "I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.", "completion": "I'll come a-running, pardner."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?", "completion": "My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it."}
{"prompt": "I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.", "completion": "Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling."}
{"prompt": "I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.", "completion": "Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you."}
{"prompt": "Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.", "completion": "Say, I want to be sure, too!"}
{"prompt": "There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.", "completion": "Gee! Take a look, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.", "completion": "The money? Why?"}
{"prompt": "She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.", "completion": "That's the kind of stuff they want!"}
{"prompt": "And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.", "completion": "I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?"}
{"prompt": "Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.", "completion": "Ts! Ts! Ts!"}
{"prompt": "If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!", "completion": "I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --", "completion": "I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you."}
{"prompt": "Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.", "completion": "And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here..."}
{"prompt": "What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?", "completion": "No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office."}
{"prompt": "So long.", "completion": "Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.", "completion": "Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long."}
{"prompt": "Thanks a lot.", "completion": "Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.", "completion": "Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man."}
{"prompt": "That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.", "completion": "Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again."}
{"prompt": "Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.", "completion": "Well, she'll know some day."}
{"prompt": "No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.", "completion": "Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything."}
{"prompt": "And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.", "completion": "Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you."}
{"prompt": "And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.", "completion": "I'm beginning to realize that."}
{"prompt": "Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?", "completion": "Well, of course, if you put it that way."}
{"prompt": "Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.", "completion": "Well, I'm independent, too."}
{"prompt": "Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.", "completion": "I feel I ought to take care of her."}
{"prompt": "You haven't seen anything yet.", "completion": "I don't know. This makes me feel funny."}
{"prompt": "We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.", "completion": "I never knew Hildy to be so determined before."}
{"prompt": "How long would the interview take?", "completion": "Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it."}
{"prompt": "But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?", "completion": "How?"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure Williams is not all there?", "completion": "All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected."}
{"prompt": "Just what is the lowdown on Williams?", "completion": "It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down."}
{"prompt": "Anything the matter?", "completion": "Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters."}
{"prompt": "Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.", "completion": "I see what you mean."}
{"prompt": "I don't blame them.", "completion": "I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do."}
{"prompt": "How's business, Bruce?", "completion": "Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life."}
{"prompt": "Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.", "completion": "Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town..."}
{"prompt": "Just for the first year.", "completion": "That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll try to give her one.", "completion": "I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?"}
{"prompt": "I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.", "completion": "I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself."}
{"prompt": "No. My mother.", "completion": "Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind."}
{"prompt": "Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?", "completion": "Mother? But your mother --"}
{"prompt": "Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?", "completion": "Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married."}
{"prompt": "No -- she didn't.", "completion": "Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!"}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?", "completion": "Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?"}
{"prompt": "That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.", "completion": "Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce."}
{"prompt": "But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?", "completion": "Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning."}
{"prompt": "You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.", "completion": "Oh."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --", "completion": "Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all."}
{"prompt": "This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.", "completion": NaN}
{"prompt": "Yes!", "completion": "Then who are you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm Bruce Baldwin!", "completion": "You're Bruce Baldwin?"}
{"prompt": "Mr. Burns --", "completion": "I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!"}
{"prompt": "What's this?", "completion": "Get out of here, you!"}
{"prompt": "You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.", "completion": "Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions."}
{"prompt": "No, you don't!", "completion": "Do you want to get us scooped?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!", "completion": "Call Duffy!"}
{"prompt": "We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys.", "completion": "What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?"}
{"prompt": "You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.", "completion": "I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!"}
{"prompt": "We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?", "completion": "Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars."}
{"prompt": "I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.", "completion": "You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff."}
{"prompt": "No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.", "completion": "Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?"}
{"prompt": "You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.", "completion": "I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is."}
{"prompt": "I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.", "completion": "Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!"}
{"prompt": "Get out!", "completion": "Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out."}
{"prompt": "If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.", "completion": "You'll ask me to what?"}
{"prompt": "Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?", "completion": "You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of."}
{"prompt": "Save that for the Tribune.", "completion": "What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?"}
{"prompt": "Out of the mouths of babes.", "completion": "He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?"}
{"prompt": "The power of the press, huh!", "completion": "That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child."}
{"prompt": "All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!", "completion": "This is the Morning Post you're talking to!"}
{"prompt": "Your luck's not with you now!", "completion": "Duffy! Get Liebowitz!"}
{"prompt": "You -- you!!", "completion": "Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post."}
{"prompt": "Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!", "completion": "But, Hildy -- I can explain --"}
{"prompt": "Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.", "completion": "It'll be Heaven!"}
{"prompt": "Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  \"With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth.\"", "completion": "Hildy, darling!"}
{"prompt": "How about Bruce's?", "completion": "Walter, you can't do that!"}
{"prompt": "Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!", "completion": "You're not fooling anybody."}
{"prompt": "Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?", "completion": "That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.", "completion": "What!"}
{"prompt": "What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?", "completion": "Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over."}
{"prompt": "Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.", "completion": "What's the matter with my brains?"}
{"prompt": "Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.", "completion": "What would you do if it was a daughter?"}
{"prompt": "Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.", "completion": "Walter!"}
{"prompt": "Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?", "completion": "Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?"}
{"prompt": "That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!", "completion": "Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!"}
{"prompt": "Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.", "completion": "A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!"}
{"prompt": "Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.", "completion": "Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it."}
{"prompt": "Sure.", "completion": "It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?"}
{"prompt": "Where'd you wire him?", "completion": "On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.", "completion": "No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming."}
{"prompt": "And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!", "completion": "Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter."}
{"prompt": "The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Then why are you doing it?", "completion": "Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!"}
{"prompt": "Hildy!", "completion": "Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!"}
{"prompt": "Well -- what is it?", "completion": "What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!"}
{"prompt": "Flip a coin.", "completion": "All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?"}
{"prompt": "He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?", "completion": "I don't know what to do, Walter."}
{"prompt": "Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.", "completion": "Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --"}
{"prompt": "Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.", "completion": "Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.", "completion": "That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours."}
{"prompt": "In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.", "completion": "Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?", "completion": "We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week."}
{"prompt": "Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?", "completion": "Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!"}
{"prompt": "I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.", "completion": "We've certainly been in some swell jams."}
{"prompt": "Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.", "completion": "In a way."}
{"prompt": "Don't tell me you were worried!", "completion": "Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?"}
{"prompt": "And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.", "completion": "How was that for a tight squeeze?"}
{"prompt": "Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.", "completion": "Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment."}
{"prompt": "When did you deliver this first?", "completion": "Who did you talk to?"}
{"prompt": "Murder, uh?", "completion": "Hanging an innocent man to win an election!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.", "completion": "Wait a minute!  Let go there!"}
{"prompt": "What is it? Here!", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --", "completion": "No, you don't! Walter!"}
{"prompt": "I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!", "completion": "Don't open that!"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.", "completion": "When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --"}
{"prompt": "Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --", "completion": "Will you come here?"}
{"prompt": "Ring that number, will you?", "completion": "Come here. See if we can move it."}
{"prompt": "Lafayette two-one-hundred.", "completion": "That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?"}
{"prompt": "Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?", "completion": "Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?", "completion": "Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!"}
{"prompt": "Is this the Community Hospital?", "completion": "I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?"}
{"prompt": "Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.", "completion": "I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!"}
{"prompt": "Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?", "completion": "Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!"}
{"prompt": "Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.", "completion": "What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?"}
{"prompt": "Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.", "completion": "Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?"}
{"prompt": "Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!", "completion": "Hello -- hello..."}
{"prompt": "I'm looking at you -- you murderer!", "completion": "If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!"}
{"prompt": "I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!", "completion": "Look at me, Hildy --"}
{"prompt": "What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?", "completion": "If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?"}
{"prompt": "Was she? Did you notice?", "completion": "It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be."}
{"prompt": "Louie!", "completion": "Don't tell me -- was she killed?"}
{"prompt": "You been in a fight?", "completion": "Where is she? Tell me!"}
{"prompt": "What did you do with her?", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.", "completion": "Where's Mrs. Baldwin?"}
{"prompt": "Finished!", "completion": "Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?"}
{"prompt": "Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!", "completion": "I'm finished."}
{"prompt": "Double-crossing swine!", "completion": "You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this."}
{"prompt": "Is he coming back here?", "completion": "Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?"}
{"prompt": "What tickets?", "completion": "Railroad tickets."}
{"prompt": "Where's Bruce?", "completion": "Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets."}
{"prompt": "Where's Butch?", "completion": "Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!"}
{"prompt": "All right, Walter.", "completion": "Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, Walter.", "completion": "Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!", "completion": "For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!"}
{"prompt": "Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!", "completion": "How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?"}
{"prompt": "Where's some paper?", "completion": "Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?"}
{"prompt": "How much do you want on it?", "completion": "All the words you've got."}
{"prompt": "Huh!", "completion": "Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!"}
{"prompt": "We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.", "completion": "Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!", "completion": "You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside."}
{"prompt": "We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?", "completion": "That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him."}
{"prompt": "Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!", "completion": "Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --"}
{"prompt": "You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.", "completion": "Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!"}
{"prompt": "Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.", "completion": "I get it!"}
{"prompt": "Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!", "completion": "I'd like to think."}
{"prompt": "You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!", "completion": "Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?"}
{"prompt": "You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!", "completion": "I know, but --"}
{"prompt": "Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!", "completion": "Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!"}
{"prompt": "Where do you think you're going?", "completion": "Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?"}
{"prompt": "She jumped out of the window.", "completion": "I know. Where is he, I said."}
{"prompt": "Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?", "completion": "Yes. Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.", "completion": "Hold on a minute."}
{"prompt": "No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.", "completion": "That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!", "completion": "No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?"}
{"prompt": "I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!", "completion": "Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --"}
{"prompt": "You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.", "completion": "Wait a minute. Your mother's alive."}
{"prompt": "Never mind that. What's the story?", "completion": "Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!"}
{"prompt": "Exclusive? That's great.", "completion": "It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley."}
{"prompt": "All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?", "completion": "No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified."}
{"prompt": "What do you think I am -- a crook?", "completion": "Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?"}
{"prompt": "What tricks would I pull?", "completion": "Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?"}
{"prompt": "Now you're talking!", "completion": "You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!"}
{"prompt": "We're not interested.", "completion": "Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.", "completion": "All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!", "completion": "What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?"}
{"prompt": "You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!", "completion": "How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!"}
{"prompt": "I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --", "completion": "Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!"}
{"prompt": "Especially with an election coming up in a few days.", "completion": "No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same."}
{"prompt": "Because it happened to be a colored policeman.", "completion": "The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town."}
{"prompt": "So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.", "completion": "If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?"}
{"prompt": "His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.", "completion": "You said it."}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "What now?"}
{"prompt": "Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.", "completion": "Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.", "completion": "I might have, Walter, but you were never there."}
{"prompt": "I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.", "completion": "How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!"}
{"prompt": "Allow me.", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!", "completion": "Oh, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.", "completion": "No kidding?"}
{"prompt": "Now you got me.", "completion": "Nothing personal. I was just asking."}
{"prompt": "Better.", "completion": "Then what does he want with you?"}
{"prompt": "Afraid? I should say not!", "completion": "All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.", "completion": "You're not afraid, are you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.", "completion": "Say, could I meet him?"}
{"prompt": "Thanks...", "completion": "Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries."}
{"prompt": "The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.", "completion": "I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.", "completion": "Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.", "completion": "Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.", "completion": "He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?"}
{"prompt": "It's a good, honest business, isn't it?", "completion": "Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies."}
{"prompt": "He's in the insurance business.", "completion": "The insurance business?"}
{"prompt": "Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.", "completion": "What's his line?"}
{"prompt": "Bermuda.", "completion": "Bermuda... Rich, eh?"}
{"prompt": "A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.", "completion": "Where'd you meet this man?"}
{"prompt": "That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.", "completion": "I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you."}
{"prompt": "You can't sell me that, Walter.", "completion": "Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man."}
{"prompt": "I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.", "completion": "Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business."}
{"prompt": "Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --", "completion": "Look at this!"}
{"prompt": "Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?", "completion": "I'm not working for any other paper!"}
{"prompt": "All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!", "completion": "Please! Will you just --"}
{"prompt": "If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.", "completion": "Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --"}
{"prompt": "Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.", "completion": "Get away, Svengali."}
{"prompt": "It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.", "completion": "That's what I'm afraid of. \"Any time -- any place -- anywhere!\""}
{"prompt": "You've got to help me, Hildy.", "completion": "Keep away --"}
{"prompt": "There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!", "completion": "No!"}
{"prompt": "I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?", "completion": "Well, haven't you got anybody else?"}
{"prompt": "Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!", "completion": "Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?"}
{"prompt": "Sweeney.", "completion": "Dead?"}
{"prompt": "Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.", "completion": "What's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!", "completion": "You -- you --"}
{"prompt": "It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.", "completion": "I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!"}
{"prompt": "I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.", "completion": "Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter."}
{"prompt": "Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.", "completion": "Listen, Walter --"}
{"prompt": "What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --", "completion": "You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!"}
{"prompt": "Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --", "completion": "I know, Walter, but I --"}
{"prompt": "You've had a better offer, eh?", "completion": "You bet I've got a better offer."}
{"prompt": "You mean you're not coming back to work here?", "completion": "That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --"}
{"prompt": "What do you mean by that?", "completion": "Just what I said. That's what I --"}
{"prompt": "Sure you can. Come on.", "completion": "Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss."}
{"prompt": "You can break it, can't you?", "completion": "No, I can't."}
{"prompt": "Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.", "completion": "I have a lunch date. I just want --"}
{"prompt": "I haven't any hard feelings.", "completion": "Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?"}
{"prompt": "Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.", "completion": "What?!!"}
{"prompt": "Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.", "completion": "Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --"}
{"prompt": "Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.", "completion": "All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.", "completion": "What home?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.", "completion": "A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it."}
{"prompt": "Now, that's a nice thing to say.", "completion": "Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?"}
{"prompt": "Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.", "completion": "I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker."}
{"prompt": "Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.", "completion": "Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for."}
{"prompt": "You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.", "completion": "Done what?"}
{"prompt": "I notice you still remember it.", "completion": "I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --", "completion": "You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  \"-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!\""}
{"prompt": "Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?", "completion": "No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now."}
{"prompt": "You know what. How long since we've seen each other?", "completion": "Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?", "completion": "How long is what?"}
{"prompt": "Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.", "completion": "Hello, Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "Let me out! Let me out of here!", "completion": "What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!", "completion": "You grey-haired old Judas!"}
{"prompt": "Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.", "completion": "I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!"}
{"prompt": "Are you referring to me, Madam?", "completion": "You know you did!"}
{"prompt": "Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.", "completion": "What's that -- what's that?"}
{"prompt": "I mean real money -- not counterfeit!", "completion": "I always have both."}
{"prompt": "You got plenty of money?", "completion": "Sure, boss."}
{"prompt": "Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.", "completion": "You know me. The shirt off my back."}
{"prompt": "Beat it out and get hold of some guys.", "completion": "Who do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Western an' Thirty-fourth.", "completion": "Anything you want, Boss."}
{"prompt": "I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?", "completion": "You stay here. I'll find out everything."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.", "completion": "Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station."}
{"prompt": "Take that mush out of your mouth!", "completion": "Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.", "completion": "Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.", "completion": "Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!"}
{"prompt": "They can't do that to me!", "completion": "Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here."}
{"prompt": "You're crazy. Where's Mac?", "completion": "He's on my phone. He just called me."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!"}
{"prompt": "I'm busy, Duffy.", "completion": "Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!"}
{"prompt": "First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?", "completion": "Walter!"}
{"prompt": "It's a deal. Let me up.", "completion": "Let's see the money."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?"}
{"prompt": "I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --", "completion": "A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --"}
{"prompt": "Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --", "completion": "There's money in it, Cooley."}
{"prompt": "I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.", "completion": "Cooley, I want to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?", "completion": "I think it is."}
{"prompt": "I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?", "completion": "No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over."}
{"prompt": "Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.", "completion": "Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.", "completion": "I don't know --"}
{"prompt": "Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.", "completion": "It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing."}
{"prompt": "We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.", "completion": "A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?", "completion": "Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me."}
{"prompt": "They're always after me for interviews.", "completion": "Me, too."}
{"prompt": "The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.", "completion": "You said it!"}
{"prompt": "Well, it wasn't exactly that way --", "completion": "Point the gun at me!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me."}
{"prompt": "In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.", "completion": "Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?"}
{"prompt": "The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.", "completion": "I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?", "completion": "You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?"}
{"prompt": "Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!", "completion": "Are you gentlemen all through with me?"}
{"prompt": "It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.", "completion": "Better let us in on it, Mollie."}
{"prompt": "Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.", "completion": "A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it."}
{"prompt": "She looks as though she's going to come to.", "completion": "Give me a hand with her, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?", "completion": "Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to."}
{"prompt": "Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.", "completion": "Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Hey!", "completion": "Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!"}
{"prompt": "Open up there, will you!", "completion": "All right -- all right!"}
{"prompt": "Who locked the door?", "completion": "Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!"}
{"prompt": "Three bullets! Any good?", "completion": "Beats king up."}
{"prompt": "I know, I just want to give him a thrill.", "completion": "I call. What you got?"}
{"prompt": "Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?", "completion": "Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk."}
{"prompt": "I'll have it in a minute.", "completion": "Well, that about covers everything."}
{"prompt": "Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!", "completion": "Hold the phone!"}
{"prompt": "Where is he, before we beat it out of you?", "completion": "Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree."}
{"prompt": "Come on, you! Before we slap you down.", "completion": "Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.", "completion": "I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both."}
{"prompt": "Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?", "completion": "Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?"}
{"prompt": "What's the dope, Sheriff?", "completion": "Who engineered this getaway?"}
{"prompt": "Call you back.", "completion": "So have we!"}
{"prompt": "No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.", "completion": "The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture."}
{"prompt": "Boy, did you see her go?", "completion": "Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub."}
{"prompt": "You guys wanna play some more poker?", "completion": "What's the use? I can't win a pot."}
{"prompt": "She says she's gonna write fiction.", "completion": "Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter."}
{"prompt": "Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.", "completion": "Who's this guy she's gonna marry?"}
{"prompt": "Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'", "completion": "What have you got, Hildy?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?", "completion": "Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!"}
{"prompt": "That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.", "completion": "This Egelhoffer's pretty good."}
{"prompt": "We know what you're up to.", "completion": "Probably goin' out to get Williams."}
{"prompt": "You ain't gettin' out o' here!", "completion": "Now, where is he?"}
{"prompt": "What a chase!", "completion": "No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back."}
{"prompt": "Goodbye, Yonson.", "completion": "So long, Hildy."}
{"prompt": "I'll call.", "completion": "Three sixes. Is that any good?"}
{"prompt": "Gus, this --", "completion": "Good coffee, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.", "completion": "That's all right."}
{"prompt": "No -- just coffee, Gus.", "completion": "Just coffee.  And you, sir?"}
{"prompt": "Little rum in yours, too?", "completion": "I guess so."}
{"prompt": "I can't complain.", "completion": "Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee."}
{"prompt": "All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.", "completion": "How's everything, Gus?"}
{"prompt": "He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.", "completion": "That's murder!"}
{"prompt": "He's harmless.", "completion": "Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "With a bag of marshmallows."}
{"prompt": "Not this gun!", "completion": "He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer."}
{"prompt": "Where'd you get this?", "completion": "I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to."}
{"prompt": "What do I know about Williams?", "completion": "All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk."}
{"prompt": "Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!", "completion": "Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!", "completion": "I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --"}
{"prompt": "I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.", "completion": "Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on."}
{"prompt": "Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.", "completion": "Hang onto her! Keep her in here!"}
{"prompt": "Take your paws off me!", "completion": "Hold her, boys!"}
{"prompt": "Just a minute, Johnson!", "completion": "Let go o' me. What's the idea?"}
{"prompt": "You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.", "completion": "That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later."}
{"prompt": "Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?", "completion": "No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight."}
{"prompt": "Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?", "completion": "Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --"}
{"prompt": "I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.", "completion": "All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say."}
{"prompt": "Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.", "completion": "Same way you did.  Through that gate."}
{"prompt": "Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --", "completion": "Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --", "completion": "After all I've done for you --"}
{"prompt": "Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --", "completion": "A fine fair-weather friend you are!"}
{"prompt": "This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.", "completion": "What went off?"}
{"prompt": "That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.", "completion": "If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am."}
{"prompt": "No, I couldn't do that.", "completion": "Just one second --"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. But I --", "completion": "Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference."}
{"prompt": "Earl Williams. The reprieve.", "completion": "Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!"}
{"prompt": "You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.", "completion": "For who?"}
{"prompt": "So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.", "completion": "I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?"}
{"prompt": "I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.", "completion": "And so do I!"}
{"prompt": "I was just going to!", "completion": "Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle."}
{"prompt": "I never saw him before!", "completion": "Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary."}
{"prompt": "It's a frame-up! Some imposter!", "completion": "That's a lie!!"}
{"prompt": "Throw him out, Frank.", "completion": "You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!"}
{"prompt": "Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!", "completion": "Who is this man?"}
{"prompt": "A sight for sore eyes!", "completion": "Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!"}
{"prompt": "Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.", "completion": "Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?"}
{"prompt": "Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.", "completion": "If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience."}
{"prompt": "Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.", "completion": "Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Shoot to kill, I said.", "completion": "I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out."}
{"prompt": "All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "We'll fix that, too.", "completion": "Just -- one -- second!"}
{"prompt": "Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!", "completion": "Now what do you say?"}
{"prompt": "No -- don't out me off.", "completion": "How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!"}
{"prompt": "I did.  Hold the wire.", "completion": "Cover up that transmitter!"}
{"prompt": "They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.", "completion": "Tell 'em to hold the wire."}
{"prompt": "Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --", "completion": "And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!"}
{"prompt": "We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?", "completion": "Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you."}
{"prompt": "An attempt to ruin us!", "completion": "Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!"}
{"prompt": "And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?", "completion": "Pure politics!"}
{"prompt": "But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.", "completion": "The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!"}
{"prompt": "Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --", "completion": "I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?"}
{"prompt": "We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.", "completion": "Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!"}
{"prompt": "If there was any way out...", "completion": "That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!"}
{"prompt": "I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.", "completion": "Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister."}
{"prompt": "Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.", "completion": "Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature."}
{"prompt": "I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.", "completion": "Fred!"}
{"prompt": "Pete, you're through!", "completion": "What do you mean -- through?"}
{"prompt": "Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?", "completion": "If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years."}
{"prompt": "Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?", "completion": "I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night."}
{"prompt": "Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --", "completion": "Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies."}
{"prompt": "Did you actually give Williams that gun?", "completion": "The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!"}
{"prompt": "Pete, I want to talk to you!", "completion": "I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after."}
{"prompt": "Got you, Williams!", "completion": "Go on -- shoot me!"}
{"prompt": "I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.", "completion": "Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor."}
{"prompt": "I won't.", "completion": "Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?"}
{"prompt": "Fine, thanks, Sheriff.", "completion": "That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?"}
{"prompt": "You'll take fifty and like it!", "completion": "Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam."}
{"prompt": "You can let him out on bail, can't you?", "completion": "Five hundred dollars."}
{"prompt": "All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!", "completion": "Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out."}
{"prompt": "Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?", "completion": "I can't."}
{"prompt": "And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?", "completion": "Now, Hildy --"}
{"prompt": "Let him out of here, Lieutenant.", "completion": "But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him."}
{"prompt": "Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!", "completion": "All right, Judge."}
{"prompt": "-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?", "completion": "Was I? The driver got knocked cold."}
{"prompt": "What did you do with her?", "completion": "Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street."}
{"prompt": "Oh-h-h... was she hurt?", "completion": "I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!"}
{"prompt": "I'm telling you!", "completion": "We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!"}
{"prompt": "My name is Louis Peluso.", "completion": "Where's the old lady?"}
{"prompt": "Editorials?", "completion": "Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!"}
{"prompt": "I'll go right after it.", "completion": "Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man."}
{"prompt": "Give me that!", "completion": "There goes another scrub lady."}
{"prompt": "Who is it?", "completion": "Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?"}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.", "completion": "Phone for you, Hildy."}
{"prompt": "Any news?", "completion": "Yeah. I was never so tired in my life."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.", "completion": "I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!"}
{"prompt": "Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.", "completion": "This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean \"dear.\" That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter? Getting yellow?", "completion": "It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please."}
{"prompt": "What's the use of fighting, Hildy?", "completion": "Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.", "completion": "Look out, you --"}
{"prompt": "Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --", "completion": "Okay.  Forget it."}
{"prompt": "No -- what?", "completion": "If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back."}
{"prompt": "I thought so, too.", "completion": "Did you get that, Hildy?"}
{"prompt": "I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.", "completion": "Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone."}
{"prompt": "But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.", "completion": "Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.", "completion": "Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know why you boys are so good to me.", "completion": "Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?"}
{"prompt": "You fight it cut.", "completion": "And up a dime."}
{"prompt": "No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?", "completion": "What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!"}
{"prompt": "You know it is!", "completion": "I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was."}
{"prompt": "None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!", "completion": "Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?"}
{"prompt": "So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Here!", "completion": "Thanks. So long, Hildy!"}
{"prompt": "Where's the money?", "completion": "Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign."}
{"prompt": "Come on with that money!", "completion": "First you got to sign a receipt."}
{"prompt": "Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!", "completion": "All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?"}
{"prompt": "Have you got my dough?", "completion": "Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Hiding him where?", "completion": "Mother!"}
{"prompt": "Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.", "completion": "Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear."}
{"prompt": "From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.", "completion": "Hildy, I thought you were gone --"}
{"prompt": "'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.", "completion": "Any dope yet on how he got out?"}
{"prompt": "Kings and sixes.", "completion": "That's good."}
{"prompt": "That man there!", "completion": "Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me."}
{"prompt": "I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.", "completion": "Mother!"}
{"prompt": "You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!", "completion": "I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing."}
{"prompt": "Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!", "completion": "Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --"}
{"prompt": "We'll get you out in ten minutes.", "completion": "Mother!"}
{"prompt": "Let 'em take me. It's better that way.", "completion": "What good'll it do?"}
{"prompt": "Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?", "completion": "Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back."}
{"prompt": "Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.", "completion": "How'd you get here, Earl?"}
{"prompt": "Sure I do, Earl.", "completion": "Quiet, Mollie, quiet!"}
{"prompt": "Don't talk too loud.", "completion": "Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.", "completion": "Well, maybe you think I could!"}
{"prompt": "Keep away!", "completion": "Earl, you must never do that again."}
{"prompt": "What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.", "completion": "I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either."}
{"prompt": "No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.", "completion": "Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.", "completion": "Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody."}
{"prompt": "Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?", "completion": "Don't move!"}
{"prompt": "You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your \"Production for Use\".", "completion": "Yes -- that's right. Production for use."}
{"prompt": "You're not going to phone anybody where I am.", "completion": "Put down that gun, Earl."}
{"prompt": "Don't forget about production for use.", "completion": "I won't, Earl."}
{"prompt": "Isn't that her picture?", "completion": "Yes. Isn't she beautiful?"}
{"prompt": "No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?", "completion": "Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person."}
{"prompt": "Very simple, Earl.", "completion": "There's nothing crazy about that, is there?"}
{"prompt": "Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?", "completion": "Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.", "completion": "A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course."}
{"prompt": "\"Production for use only.\" Well, maybe that's the answer.", "completion": "It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?"}
{"prompt": "How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?", "completion": "I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense."}
{"prompt": "What are your beliefs, Earl?", "completion": "They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things."}
{"prompt": "You didn't mean to kill that policeman?", "completion": "Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.", "completion": "I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else."}
{"prompt": "Shut up, you!", "completion": "Are you all right, now?"}
{"prompt": "Never mind! Just play dead.", "completion": "Hey --"}
{"prompt": "I'll be right here. I won't leave you.", "completion": "What's the idea?"}
{"prompt": "Ssh!", "completion": "I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe."}
{"prompt": "There's somethin' funny going on around here.", "completion": "They'll get him! They'll get him!"}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "Quiet, Mollie!"}
{"prompt": "Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!", "completion": "What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute, Mollie.", "completion": "They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!"}
{"prompt": "It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!", "completion": "Where are they gone? You know where they are?"}
{"prompt": "They're not human!", "completion": "They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way."}
{"prompt": "I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --", "completion": "Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you."}
{"prompt": "A very fine-looking women.", "completion": "She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --"}
{"prompt": "You're insane!", "completion": "Here's the picture of my wife."}
{"prompt": "You can't bribe me!", "completion": "They wouldn't take it."}
{"prompt": "No! It's easy -- it's very easy!", "completion": "Get out of here!"}
{"prompt": "I'll explain it tomorrow!", "completion": "Is it hard?"}
{"prompt": "All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.", "completion": "You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do."}
{"prompt": "Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?", "completion": "Pinkus."}
{"prompt": "No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.", "completion": "But how do I know...?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "This puts me in a peculiar hole."}
{"prompt": "I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.", "completion": "No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!"}
{"prompt": "No, I don't think so.", "completion": "For heaven's sake, why not?"}
{"prompt": "I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.", "completion": "But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses."}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes!", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "The City Sealer's office!", "completion": "You mean here in the city?"}
{"prompt": "Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.", "completion": "The what?"}
{"prompt": "Who? Me?", "completion": "Who do you think!"}
{"prompt": "How much do you make a week? What's your salary?", "completion": "Forty dollars."}
{"prompt": "How much do you make a week?", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?", "completion": "Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?"}
{"prompt": "You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.", "completion": "Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!"}
{"prompt": "They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.", "completion": "Get the Governor on the phone!"}
{"prompt": "What's from the Governor?", "completion": "The reprieve for Earl Williams."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor."}
{"prompt": "Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --", "completion": "-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --"}
{"prompt": "What's your hurry?", "completion": "We want to see you."}
{"prompt": "There she is!", "completion": "Say, Hildy..."}
{"prompt": "Get the cops, somebody.", "completion": "Come on, fellas."}
{"prompt": "Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.", "completion": "Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?"}
{"prompt": "Look out!", "completion": "Look out where you're aiming, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.", "completion": "Hello, Mollie."}
{"prompt": "If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.", "completion": "It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!"}
{"prompt": "The door was locked.", "completion": "She and Mollie were talking."}
{"prompt": "What's he want?", "completion": "Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited."}
{"prompt": "Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.", "completion": "Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself."}
{"prompt": "Baldwin -- his name is.", "completion": "I give that marriage six months."}
{"prompt": "Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.", "completion": "His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all."}
{"prompt": "Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?", "completion": "Apparently so."}
{"prompt": "It's true.", "completion": "You're much more convincing when you're making it up."}
{"prompt": "With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.", "completion": "You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk."}
{"prompt": "I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.", "completion": "Only till they get you into the local school."}
{"prompt": "Very well, Grandpa.", "completion": "You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school."}
{"prompt": "I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...", "completion": "Give him the you-know-what."}
{"prompt": "This is going too far, young man.", "completion": "But Grandpa, you said..."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you."}
{"prompt": "No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.", "completion": "Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?"}
{"prompt": "I know.", "completion": "You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another."}
{"prompt": "I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.", "completion": "That was a googly!"}
{"prompt": "Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.", "completion": "Never let a rat creep up on you."}
{"prompt": "So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.", "completion": "Can I try?"}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year."}
{"prompt": "Won't they have maps?", "completion": "They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork."}
{"prompt": "OK. You're in.", "completion": "They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way."}
{"prompt": "Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.", "completion": "Bugger off, you bloody sod."}
{"prompt": "Bloody.", "completion": "Bloody."}
{"prompt": "Sod.", "completion": "Sod."}
{"prompt": "That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.", "completion": "Bugger off."}
{"prompt": "Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.", "completion": "I only know one."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Say them."}
{"prompt": "I don't mind.", "completion": "Do you know any swear words?"}
{"prompt": "They're not.", "completion": "You want to join our gang?"}
{"prompt": "Who told you that?", "completion": "My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. \"Boys are going missing all the time.\""}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites."}
{"prompt": "Yes, you was. Make him talk.", "completion": "I know a secret."}
{"prompt": "Looking for shrapnel.", "completion": "I never was."}
{"prompt": "Yes, she did, didn't she?", "completion": "What are you doing here? This is our territory"}
{"prompt": "Pauline's mum got killed.", "completion": "No, she didn't."}
{"prompt": "Pauline.", "completion": "Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how."}
{"prompt": "It's easy. I've done it.", "completion": "Who with?"}
{"prompt": "We thought it was poison.", "completion": "I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about."}
{"prompt": "Not now. They wouldn't believe me.", "completion": "Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam."}
{"prompt": "You do it. You're a girl.", "completion": "Tell them about Pauline's mum."}
{"prompt": "Go and ask her if she wants to play.", "completion": "Ask her yourself."}
{"prompt": "You couldn't.", "completion": "Could."}
{"prompt": "You wouldn't.", "completion": "Would."}

{"prompt": "Well, for the baby, really.", "completion": "Thank you Billy, from the baby and me."}
{"prompt": "That's not the point.", "completion": "You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.", "completion": "You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam."}
{"prompt": "I'm starting my own collection.", "completion": "It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?"}
{"prompt": "It's not the same.", "completion": "Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face."}
{"prompt": "Can't we just see the end?", "completion": "They've got the real thing outside."}
{"prompt": "Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.", "completion": "...and six..."}
{"prompt": "The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.", "completion": "...and four and five..."}
{"prompt": "You're the biggest fibber.", "completion": "It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart."}
{"prompt": "I did see them. I did.", "completion": "He's the worst liar."}
{"prompt": "You said that last year, Dad.", "completion": "The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we."}
{"prompt": "It's like telling fibs.", "completion": "That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.", "completion": "Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this."}
{"prompt": "The sodding water table.", "completion": "But Dad, It's the News."}
{"prompt": "We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?", "completion": "Crocodiles! Aah!"}
{"prompt": "They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.", "completion": "Who pays for them?"}
{"prompt": "Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.", "completion": "Wow!"}
{"prompt": "Please yourself.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.", "completion": "You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know?", "completion": "You do, you do. You're just not saying."}
{"prompt": "We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Boy, that was some air-raid.", "completion": "Air-raid?"}
{"prompt": "Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....", "completion": "Don't be so cheeky, Bruce."}
{"prompt": "They might be.", "completion": "I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass."}
{"prompt": "A bit too quick.", "completion": "Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?"}
{"prompt": "And the bride.", "completion": "It was great for me, how was it for you."}
{"prompt": "Here's to music. And absent friends.", "completion": "And absent bridegrooms!"}
{"prompt": "And I'm still just a lad myself.", "completion": "Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all."}

{"prompt": "Naturally.", "completion": "I don't understand. Is there any point to it?"}
{"prompt": "Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.", "completion": "Except the servicemen."}
{"prompt": "Propaganda. We've been had.", "completion": "How's your war, Mac?"}
{"prompt": "You need trees for an avenue.", "completion": "There was talk of planting some when we first came."}
{"prompt": "Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.", "completion": "Why not?"}
{"prompt": "Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.", "completion": "What about it?"}
{"prompt": "I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.", "completion": "What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about."}
{"prompt": "If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.", "completion": "What did we know? We were seventeen."}
{"prompt": "Kiss me Hardy.", "completion": "You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot."}

{"prompt": "I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.", "completion": "What are you going to be then?"}
{"prompt": "That's it.", "completion": "Why didn't they say that before you started?"}
{"prompt": "You taste it.", "completion": "You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?"}

{"prompt": "Well?", "completion": "It looks....foreign."}
{"prompt": "Well, it's off ration. We know that.", "completion": "How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country."}

{"prompt": "Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.", "completion": "No Turks."}
{"prompt": "Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?", "completion": "Now take deep breaths, and push."}
{"prompt": "It's not. It's happening to me.", "completion": "It looks a bit fishy to me."}
{"prompt": "Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.", "completion": "I don't believe this is happening to me."}
{"prompt": "He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.", "completion": "I think it's very sensible in the circumstances."}
{"prompt": "Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.", "completion": "What did he say?"}
{"prompt": "What is it, pet?", "completion": "He's being posted. I was terrible to him."}
{"prompt": "You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.", "completion": "Who said anything about love?"}

{"prompt": "The ideas you get in your head.", "completion": "That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there."}
{"prompt": "Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?", "completion": "Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me."}
{"prompt": "What would we do if a German came into the house?", "completion": "Don't be silly, Dawn."}
{"prompt": "He always knows.", "completion": "Half the time he's bluffing."}

{"prompt": "Just ignore her, Mac.", "completion": "You know it? It must be an old one."}
{"prompt": "I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.", "completion": "This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started."}
{"prompt": "...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.", "completion": "Wasn't it lovely?"}
{"prompt": "Up to six weeks, I think.", "completion": "How are we going to cope?"}
{"prompt": "Or what?", "completion": "Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?"}
{"prompt": "Is it peace in out time?", "completion": "No, Mother! It's War! War!"}
{"prompt": "I wish it could all have been different.", "completion": "Look after yourself, Grace."}
{"prompt": "Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?", "completion": "You might still have a house."}
{"prompt": "We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.", "completion": "We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac."}
{"prompt": "We did the decent thing.", "completion": "This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back."}
{"prompt": "Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.", "completion": "He could always make me laugh."}
{"prompt": "It's all better left unsaid, Grace.", "completion": "You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did."}
{"prompt": "She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'", "completion": "Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back."}
{"prompt": "Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?", "completion": "A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless."}
{"prompt": "Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.", "completion": "Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly."}

{"prompt": "It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.", "completion": "Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want."}
{"prompt": "How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.", "completion": "I can't do it. What's the point?"}
{"prompt": "And now we're glad you did.", "completion": "It was the best time of his life."}
{"prompt": "How long?", "completion": "What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn."}
{"prompt": "What did I do to deserve this?", "completion": "You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us."}

{"prompt": "Am I? Maybe I am.", "completion": "You've been drinking. Your tipsy."}
{"prompt": "Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.", "completion": "You're having me on, Molly."}
{"prompt": "You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.", "completion": "Molly!"}
{"prompt": "I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.", "completion": "I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own."}
{"prompt": "I know you mean well.", "completion": "God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor."}
{"prompt": "Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.", "completion": "I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?"}
{"prompt": "My aunt in Australia has offered..", "completion": "It's so far way. I couldn't bear it."}
{"prompt": "Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.", "completion": "It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.", "completion": "Please don't kill us, please don't kill us."}
{"prompt": "Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.", "completion": "I agree."}
{"prompt": "Cool.", "completion": "The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene."}
{"prompt": "I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.", "completion": "Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love."}
{"prompt": "Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.", "completion": "I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese."}
{"prompt": "Cone.", "completion": "Huh... what cone?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.", "completion": "Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.", "completion": "Really, wow, so it's really a real thing."}
{"prompt": "Yikes.", "completion": "Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey."}
{"prompt": "Really, that's a long time.", "completion": "Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.", "completion": "Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years."}

{"prompt": "What about R.J.?", "completion": "Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel."}
{"prompt": "Whoopie fucking doo.", "completion": "Tiny's home."}
{"prompt": "OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.", "completion": "Hey, great they're back."}
{"prompt": "Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?", "completion": "That's not something to joke about."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?", "completion": "What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long."}
{"prompt": "Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.", "completion": "I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late."}
{"prompt": "A dead one.", "completion": "Mmmmm, this is tasty."}
{"prompt": "You're welcome.", "completion": "Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?"}

{"prompt": "Fuck. I think we blew a tire.", "completion": "OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet."}
{"prompt": "No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.", "completion": "What was that?"}
{"prompt": "That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.", "completion": "Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit."}

{"prompt": "Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?", "completion": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Keep straight on this road here.", "completion": "How much further?"}
{"prompt": "Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?", "completion": "Hell yeah."}

{"prompt": "Hot has got nothing to do with it.", "completion": "Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end."}
{"prompt": "Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.", "completion": "Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts."}
{"prompt": "I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.", "completion": "I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.", "completion": "Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, no shit.", "completion": "As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse."}
{"prompt": "Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?", "completion": "If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot."}
{"prompt": "Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.", "completion": "There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself."}
{"prompt": "Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.", "completion": "She's pretty cute."}
{"prompt": "Lock the fucking doors.", "completion": "Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig."}
{"prompt": "I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.", "completion": "Don't look back, just get in the car."}
{"prompt": "Man, it's already ten thirty.", "completion": "Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else."}
{"prompt": "That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.", "completion": "Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, showtime for what?", "completion": "Just grin and bear it."}
{"prompt": "I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.", "completion": "What's he so excited about?"}
{"prompt": "Turn that fucking radio off!", "completion": "Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage."}
{"prompt": "He won't move.", "completion": "Fuck! We are fucked!"}
{"prompt": "Here he comes.", "completion": "Honk at him. Scare him."}
{"prompt": "It won't work.", "completion": "I like sleep."}
{"prompt": "I gotta open the gate.", "completion": "Drive through it!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?", "completion": "What are you doing!"}
{"prompt": "How much is a person supposed to stand?", "completion": "Quiet."}
{"prompt": "This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.", "completion": "Just sit back and enjoy the show."}
{"prompt": "Check this out.", "completion": "Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace."}
{"prompt": "I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.", "completion": "Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here."}
{"prompt": "Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.", "completion": "Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched."}
{"prompt": "Fine! I'll go straight!", "completion": "Forget it. I'll just go."}
{"prompt": "Fine. I'll go straight.", "completion": "What!"}
{"prompt": "Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.", "completion": "What?"}

{"prompt": "There's not enough room.", "completion": "Then run him over, he'll move."}
{"prompt": "There's a dog in the road.", "completion": "Go around him."}
{"prompt": "Where ya headed?", "completion": "Why are we stopping?"}
{"prompt": "She looks like a freak.", "completion": "Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland."}
{"prompt": "Should we stop?", "completion": "We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area."}
{"prompt": "Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.", "completion": "It's a girl."}
{"prompt": "We'll need pictures of the inside too.", "completion": "Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer."}

{"prompt": "Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.", "completion": "How's about you give me those same directions."}
{"prompt": "And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.", "completion": "Is that all... think real hard."}
{"prompt": "Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.", "completion": "And..."}

{"prompt": "What I need are some answers.", "completion": "Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?", "completion": "Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about."}
{"prompt": "I hear ya.", "completion": "Fuck your grandmother."}
{"prompt": "Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?", "completion": "Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass."}

{"prompt": "Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.", "completion": "I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.", "completion": "Worse than a fucking rabid baboon."}

{"prompt": "What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.", "completion": "He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin."}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all."}
{"prompt": "No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.", "completion": "You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much."}
{"prompt": "How's he get around out here?", "completion": "You sure you don't need any help in there?"}
{"prompt": "He should be back in a couple hours.", "completion": "Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.", "completion": "How long is that gonna take?"}
{"prompt": "No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.", "completion": "That's nice."}
{"prompt": "Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?", "completion": "No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more."}

{"prompt": "So what?", "completion": "I don't know, I just thought it was interesting."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, \"criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946.\""}
{"prompt": "So.", "completion": "Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?", "completion": "It says, \"records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility.\""}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah.", "completion": "Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder."}
{"prompt": "Fuck, it's freezing.", "completion": "Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan."}
{"prompt": "Hey, maybe she knows where this is?", "completion": "That seems likely."}
{"prompt": "Ugh, what's that smell?", "completion": "Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?"}
{"prompt": "Aw, come on. It will be fun.", "completion": "Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun."}
{"prompt": "This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.", "completion": "I don't want to see that."}
{"prompt": "Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.", "completion": "Tickets for what?"}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "Grab Mary and come inside."}
{"prompt": "Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.", "completion": "Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.", "completion": "Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid."}
{"prompt": "No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.", "completion": "Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.", "completion": "Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?"}
{"prompt": "Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?", "completion": "Don't be such a fucking smart ass."}
{"prompt": "Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.", "completion": "A couple hours!"}
{"prompt": "I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.", "completion": "Excuse me, may I please use your phone?"}
{"prompt": "Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.", "completion": "Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Shhhhhh, quiet.", "completion": "I still don't."}
{"prompt": "Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.", "completion": "I don't hear anything."}
{"prompt": "What was that?", "completion": "What? I didn't hear anything."}
{"prompt": "How long has it been?", "completion": "I don't know... about half an hour."}
{"prompt": "She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.", "completion": "Yeah, she said we looked queer."}
{"prompt": "I think I'm going fucking crazy.", "completion": "I can't believe..."}
{"prompt": "You got to be fucking joking.", "completion": "God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit."}
{"prompt": "She looks like she stinks.", "completion": "Don't even say it."}
{"prompt": "Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.", "completion": "Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked."}
{"prompt": "Maybe he's a cyborg.", "completion": "Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway."}
{"prompt": "Geez, he never gets tired does he.", "completion": "Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10."}
{"prompt": "Scattered, smothered and covered.", "completion": "Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me."}
{"prompt": "A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.", "completion": "If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.", "completion": "I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?", "completion": "It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal."}
{"prompt": "Tell me about it.", "completion": "God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me."}
{"prompt": "Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.", "completion": "I swear I've aged five years since this trip started."}
{"prompt": "Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.", "completion": "Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?"}
{"prompt": "I resign.", "completion": "Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug."}
{"prompt": "No please, let me sit this one out.", "completion": "Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer."}
{"prompt": "Sleeping.", "completion": "Rise and shine."}
{"prompt": "Yep, I found something.", "completion": "Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work."}
{"prompt": "God damn.", "completion": "You find something, Georgie?"}
{"prompt": "That's the understatement of the year.", "completion": "Yep, I suppose it is."}
{"prompt": "Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.", "completion": "Just in the wrong place at the wrong time."}
{"prompt": "Recover any bodies?", "completion": "Not yet."}
{"prompt": "Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.", "completion": "Yeah, no mercy here."}
{"prompt": "What'd we here, Georgie?", "completion": "A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley."}
{"prompt": "Open up the trunk.", "completion": "Yes, sir."}
{"prompt": "Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "What'd ya got there?", "completion": "Keys."}
{"prompt": "Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.", "completion": "Aw, honey you know I can't do that."}
{"prompt": "Great.", "completion": "Bye sweety, we could of been great together."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you mean on TV.", "completion": "No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love."}
{"prompt": "Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?", "completion": "For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show."}
{"prompt": "I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.", "completion": "Firefly."}
{"prompt": "Maybe. He's a real lady killer.", "completion": "Didn't ya think, Mary?"}
{"prompt": "I was just kidding.", "completion": "Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in."}
{"prompt": "And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.", "completion": "I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya."}
{"prompt": "Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.", "completion": "I don't doubt that."}
{"prompt": "So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?", "completion": "Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown."}
{"prompt": "What do they call you, sweety?", "completion": "Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary."}
{"prompt": "His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.", "completion": "Oh, right."}
{"prompt": "Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.", "completion": "Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone."}
{"prompt": "I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.", "completion": "I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid."}
{"prompt": "Enough with the stupid voices.", "completion": "This is way too fucked up for words."}
{"prompt": "What!", "completion": "OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality."}
{"prompt": "You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.", "completion": "Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy."}
{"prompt": "That stupid hillbilly slut.", "completion": "Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion."}
{"prompt": "God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "I'll go. It's my fault.", "completion": "You said it, not me."}
{"prompt": "Just back up.", "completion": "I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?"}
{"prompt": "We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.", "completion": "Huh?"}
{"prompt": "Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.", "completion": "Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, I'm gone.", "completion": "I'm gonna go ask him."}
{"prompt": "Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.", "completion": "I suggest you kids leave now."}
{"prompt": "I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.", "completion": "Sorry."}
{"prompt": "No, just a little too old.", "completion": "Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day."}
{"prompt": "You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.", "completion": "Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween."}
{"prompt": "Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?", "completion": "What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please."}
{"prompt": "Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.", "completion": "Fuck you, you fucking freak!"}
{"prompt": "Behold... The Fish-Boy!", "completion": "This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real."}
{"prompt": "Where is he?", "completion": "Let's go see."}
{"prompt": "Where's Bill?", "completion": "Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK."}
{"prompt": "Why? Why are you doing this?", "completion": "Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!"}
{"prompt": "Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?", "completion": "No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform."}
{"prompt": "Please, just a minute.", "completion": "Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all."}
{"prompt": "Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.", "completion": "I um... no, I don't think so..."}
{"prompt": "I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?", "completion": "Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry."}
{"prompt": "My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.", "completion": "Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.", "completion": "Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?"}
{"prompt": "Well, go get her.", "completion": "Well hello, officer."}
{"prompt": "Wait, I want to say good-bye.", "completion": "That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but..."}
{"prompt": "Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...", "completion": "Get in... now!"}
{"prompt": "I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...", "completion": "Who's your Daddy!"}
{"prompt": "What should I do?", "completion": "Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I only saw one.", "completion": "I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this."}
{"prompt": "Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.", "completion": "What! God damn, how many?"}
{"prompt": "Grampa... watch the language.", "completion": "I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs."}
{"prompt": "Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Jesus Christ.", "completion": "Call Wydell."}
{"prompt": "Tell it to my daughter.", "completion": "Shit... fuck procedure."}
{"prompt": "We gotta break it open.", "completion": "I ain't got a warrant."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?", "completion": "Over here, inside the smokehouse."}
{"prompt": "Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?", "completion": "Shhhh... you hear that?"}
{"prompt": "Turn up this road.", "completion": "Where we headed?"}
{"prompt": "No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.", "completion": "My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid."}
{"prompt": "No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.", "completion": "Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear."}
{"prompt": "Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.", "completion": "Fit the profile?"}
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "George Willis...  ...any leads?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sure there's a logical explanation.", "completion": "I pray to God there is."}
{"prompt": "Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.", "completion": "Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?"}
{"prompt": "What about the body you found?", "completion": "Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one."}
{"prompt": "Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.", "completion": "Dr. Satan?"}
{"prompt": "Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.", "completion": "That's it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.", "completion": "I'm Wydell... this is Naish."}
{"prompt": "We found one.", "completion": "Mr. Willis?"}
{"prompt": "Excuse me for a second.", "completion": "Over."}
{"prompt": "Right...  ...come on.", "completion": "Wydell."}
{"prompt": "Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.", "completion": "I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything."}
{"prompt": "Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.", "completion": "Don't worry, we'll find her."}
{"prompt": "That must be him.", "completion": "Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.", "completion": "I guess not."}
{"prompt": "Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.", "completion": "Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way."}
{"prompt": "Call the chief... We found 'em.", "completion": "You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird."}
{"prompt": "What.", "completion": "Plates match."}
{"prompt": "Hulk was dumb as shit.", "completion": "Aw, fuck."}
{"prompt": "You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.", "completion": "I always favored the Hulk."}
{"prompt": "You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.", "completion": "How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point."}
{"prompt": "Your Spidey senses tingling.", "completion": "Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.", "completion": "I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different."}
{"prompt": "Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Tell him, Harold.", "completion": "It's going famously, son, famously!"}
{"prompt": "Tell him, Harold.", "completion": "Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up."}
{"prompt": "And?", "completion": "And think about what you've done."}
{"prompt": "Harold! Tell the boy again.", "completion": "No \"buts.\" Go to your room now."}
{"prompt": "That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.", "completion": "That is the wrong fork, young man."}
{"prompt": "And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.", "completion": "Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?"}
{"prompt": "Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?", "completion": "You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake."}
{"prompt": "How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?", "completion": "Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.", "completion": "Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help."}
{"prompt": "It's embarrassing, okay?", "completion": "It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!", "completion": "I don't know why you didn't tell me about this."}
{"prompt": "Oui.", "completion": "Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date."}
{"prompt": "Let's go eat, I'm starved.", "completion": "French?"}
{"prompt": "As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?", "completion": "Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you."}
{"prompt": "You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.", "completion": "Woof."}
{"prompt": "You remind me so much of Nathan.", "completion": "Like father, like son."}
{"prompt": "Say my name.", "completion": "Gabrielle."}
{"prompt": "Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.", "completion": "Great.  God, I've wanted you forever."}
{"prompt": "Hello, my little boy.", "completion": "Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "A little resistance would be nice, damn it.", "completion": "Please let me go with you."}
{"prompt": "I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.", "completion": "Okay, my sweet. Good night."}
{"prompt": "That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?", "completion": "You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!"}
{"prompt": "Where do we look for little lost Puff?", "completion": "I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape."}
{"prompt": "We still have you and I.", "completion": "I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back."}
{"prompt": "Oui.", "completion": "That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "I want our boy back."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Something's missing.", "completion": "Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong."}
{"prompt": "That's Lila?", "completion": "A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri."}
{"prompt": "Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.", "completion": "Lila?"}
{"prompt": "Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said \" au revoir.\"", "completion": "So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men."}
{"prompt": "You were wonderful!", "completion": "Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?"}
{"prompt": "Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.", "completion": "You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?"}
{"prompt": "Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.", "completion": "Hunh."}
{"prompt": "That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!", "completion": "That's not how he tells it."}
{"prompt": "No!", "completion": "I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry."}
{"prompt": "I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.", "completion": "I've moved on."}
{"prompt": "No. You look so beautiful.", "completion": "Anyway. Come already to the point."}
{"prompt": "God, you're beautiful.", "completion": "Please. I look a mess."}
{"prompt": "Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.", "completion": "Well?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!"}
{"prompt": "Well, I think...", "completion": "You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!"}
{"prompt": "Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "I've got some things to tell you.", "completion": "Like what?"}
{"prompt": "Please. Just one minute of your time.", "completion": "Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!"}
{"prompt": "I just want to talk.", "completion": "We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!"}
{"prompt": "Hi. It's Nathan.", "completion": "Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!", "completion": "Yeah? What?"}
{"prompt": "The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.", "completion": "Urgh."}
{"prompt": "You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.", "completion": "Unnhh."}
{"prompt": "But?... But? There is a \"but,\" Nathan.", "completion": "But I don't know how to leave Lila."}
{"prompt": "No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.", "completion": "I love you so much, Gabrielle."}
{"prompt": "You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.", "completion": "Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out."}
{"prompt": "Stop. Get away.", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Very well.", "completion": "My little French."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Not in front of the boy."}
{"prompt": "Gabby, what is it?", "completion": "Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I."}
{"prompt": "Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?", "completion": "Hmmmph."}
{"prompt": "You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.", "completion": "Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?", "completion": "I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.", "completion": "Shit.  Hi, honey."}
{"prompt": "What is wrong, my darling?", "completion": "Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world."}
{"prompt": "So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...", "completion": "Shh."}
{"prompt": "It's true. I wouldn't lie.", "completion": "You are sweet."}
{"prompt": "Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.", "completion": "Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment."}
{"prompt": "I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.", "completion": "Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower."}
{"prompt": "I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.", "completion": "I am sleepy."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Happy happy.", "completion": "Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad."}
{"prompt": "Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.", "completion": "It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?"}
{"prompt": "That would be good.", "completion": "Shall we close up, then?"}
{"prompt": "When you were a little French girl?", "completion": "Oui."}
{"prompt": "Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.", "completion": "I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl."}
{"prompt": "I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?", "completion": "Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?"}
{"prompt": "Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.", "completion": "I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed."}
{"prompt": "No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.", "completion": "Is everything fine?"}
{"prompt": "Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?", "completion": "Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry."}
{"prompt": "I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?", "completion": "Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left."}
{"prompt": "You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?", "completion": "Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle."}
{"prompt": "I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?", "completion": "Of course not."}
{"prompt": "Thank you so much for accompanying me.", "completion": "Not at all."}
{"prompt": "No. Don't be silly. It's just...", "completion": "I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...", "completion": "Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and..."}
{"prompt": "No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.", "completion": "Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.", "completion": "Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this."}
{"prompt": "Oui. Perfect!", "completion": "Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here."}
{"prompt": "Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.", "completion": "Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?"}
{"prompt": "Oui.", "completion": "You decide. Today is your day."}
{"prompt": "Oui, doctor, oui.", "completion": "Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. If you think it will help.", "completion": "Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?"}
{"prompt": "That's what I'm counting on.", "completion": "But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind."}
{"prompt": "No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.", "completion": "Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us."}
{"prompt": "Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.", "completion": "I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad."}
{"prompt": "No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.", "completion": "Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you."}
{"prompt": "He's dead.", "completion": "We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows."}
{"prompt": "You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.", "completion": "What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together."}
{"prompt": "Nice night.", "completion": "Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason."}
{"prompt": "I want to be the way I was before.", "completion": "Good. I'll show you how, apey."}
{"prompt": "But I like being human now.", "completion": "You what?"}
{"prompt": "Very well.", "completion": "We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it."}
{"prompt": "It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.", "completion": "Very well."}
{"prompt": "Shan't happen again.", "completion": "It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know."}
{"prompt": "My apologies, madam.", "completion": "It's okay, Puff."}
{"prompt": "I'll be in touch.", "completion": "No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do."}
{"prompt": "I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.", "completion": "I'm really glad you two found each other."}
{"prompt": "And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.", "completion": "Shut up, you."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to miss you.", "completion": "Oh, Rosie."}
{"prompt": "Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.", "completion": "With pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Done!", "completion": "Ready!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Rosie.", "completion": "Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time."}
{"prompt": "Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?", "completion": "I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved."}
{"prompt": "Your brother should have his license revoked.", "completion": "Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt."}
{"prompt": "How'd you know where I was?", "completion": "Nathan told my brother."}
{"prompt": "Rose, please go away.", "completion": "Lila, I want to help you."}
{"prompt": "Go the fuck away, Rosie.", "completion": "Please, honey, let me in."}
{"prompt": "No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking \"do not disturb\" sign on the fucking doorknob?", "completion": "Lila, it's Rosie."}
{"prompt": "And I think I'm going to.", "completion": "Stand on a stepladder sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.", "completion": "Yeah. My brother told me."}
{"prompt": "Three foot one.", "completion": "Be still my crotch."}
{"prompt": "I have a friend you might like to meet.", "completion": "Oh?"}
{"prompt": "I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.", "completion": "Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor."}
{"prompt": "Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?", "completion": "Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear."}
{"prompt": "One night stand?", "completion": "No. I married a midget."}
{"prompt": "He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.", "completion": "Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill."}
{"prompt": "I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.", "completion": "Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.", "completion": "My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan."}
{"prompt": "My brother says he likes you, too.", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "So?", "completion": "I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work."}
{"prompt": "God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.", "completion": "Yeah, well my brother is his shrink."}
{"prompt": "Won't he be able to tell?", "completion": "My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is \"mortifyingly ashamed\", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever."}
{"prompt": "Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?", "completion": "My brother is discreet."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean?", "completion": "Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you."}
{"prompt": "Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.", "completion": "Loves animals. Loves you."}
{"prompt": "Shut up and tell me.", "completion": "Handsome, thirties, psychologist..."}
{"prompt": "Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.", "completion": "I don't get that. Is that sexual?"}
{"prompt": "Always. Ow.", "completion": "Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley."}
{"prompt": "I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.", "completion": "You still in the market for a real boy?"}
{"prompt": "Ouch. Yeah?", "completion": "Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.", "completion": "Progress!"}
{"prompt": "Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.", "completion": "Ooka."}
{"prompt": "Look at you two. You both disgust me.", "completion": "Oook. Oook."}
{"prompt": "Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.", "completion": "Ugnh."}
{"prompt": "Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?", "completion": "Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best."}
{"prompt": "Lila...", "completion": "Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.", "completion": "How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!"}
{"prompt": "I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.", "completion": "Do you know what I gave up to be with you?"}
{"prompt": "I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.", "completion": "And what did you do tonight, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Shit.", "completion": "And what did you do tonight, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.", "completion": "That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his \"mad\" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.", "completion": "So he's doing okay?"}
{"prompt": "Ummm. It's good.", "completion": "You were gone a long time."}
{"prompt": "Should I come with?", "completion": "Nah. You just relax. How's the book?"}
{"prompt": "Absolutely!", "completion": "I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much for that.", "completion": "Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances."}
{"prompt": "Oh boy!", "completion": "You just have to control it. We're not apes."}
{"prompt": "That was wonderful!", "completion": "I think he's ready."}
{"prompt": "I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.", "completion": "Bravo to you, Puff!"}
{"prompt": "Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!", "completion": "I had sold my fucking soul."}
{"prompt": "Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...", "completion": "Such as what womanly things?"}
{"prompt": "Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.", "completion": "How come?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!", "completion": "Really?"}
{"prompt": "Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.", "completion": "Have you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?", "completion": "I guess."}
{"prompt": "No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.", "completion": "My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project."}
{"prompt": "How's work?", "completion": "Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.", "completion": "I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!"}
{"prompt": "...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.", "completion": "You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!", "completion": "Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in..."}
{"prompt": "I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!", "completion": "That's great. It's a great color for you."}
{"prompt": "Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.", "completion": "That's great."}
{"prompt": "Really?", "completion": "Sure. Of course."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.", "completion": "Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want."}
{"prompt": "Do you like my new look?", "completion": "Yeah. It's nice. It's really good."}
{"prompt": "Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.", "completion": "I'm just preoccupied."}
{"prompt": "It would just be helpful to know.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.", "completion": "Of course not."}
{"prompt": "Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.", "completion": "Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot."}
{"prompt": "Good. Making progress.", "completion": "Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk."}
{"prompt": "I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?", "completion": "So, how's it going today?"}
{"prompt": "Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.", "completion": "I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men."}
{"prompt": "Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?", "completion": "You are an animal."}
{"prompt": "I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!", "completion": "I have to think! I have to think!"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.", "completion": "Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!"}
{"prompt": "Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!", "completion": "Don't quibble. You know what I mean."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...", "completion": "You have to shave? Like an ape?"}
{"prompt": "It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.", "completion": "Your entire body?"}
{"prompt": "Who from work?", "completion": "Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?"}
{"prompt": "Who is it?", "completion": "Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly."}
{"prompt": "Who is it?", "completion": "Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing in there?", "completion": "Nothing. Be right out."}
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk."}
{"prompt": "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.", "completion": "...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon..."}
{"prompt": "Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.", "completion": "You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan."}
{"prompt": "Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.", "completion": "I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here."}
{"prompt": "Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.", "completion": "Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan."}
{"prompt": "It's perfect!", "completion": "Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?", "completion": "Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal."}
{"prompt": "Actually, I just had an amusing thought.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.", "completion": "I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your..."}
{"prompt": "Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!", "completion": "He looks perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?", "completion": "I think he's feral."}
{"prompt": "Come on.", "completion": "If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that."}
{"prompt": "No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.", "completion": "It might behoove us to turn back at this point."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Something.", "completion": "A deer?"}
{"prompt": "Did you see that?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "That's very funny.", "completion": "I love you so much."}
{"prompt": "Absolutely.", "completion": "We could call it \"Quit Bugging Me, Sunny.\"  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Flares?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, darling.", "completion": "I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?"}
{"prompt": "Fifteen.", "completion": "Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save."}
{"prompt": "Of course.", "completion": "What SPF, sweetie?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, darling.", "completion": "Oh, and the sun block?"}
{"prompt": "I don't think so.  Why?", "completion": "Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?"}
{"prompt": "Terrific. Can't wait!", "completion": "Shaving cream?"}
{"prompt": "That's a great idea.", "completion": "It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!"}
{"prompt": "Why certainly!", "completion": "Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!"}
{"prompt": "Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.", "completion": "Do you? Oh do you, darling?"}
{"prompt": "I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.", "completion": "Do you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry about my parents.", "completion": "You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing in there?", "completion": "I'll be out in a minute."}
{"prompt": "Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.", "completion": "Nathan!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.", "completion": "I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?"}
{"prompt": "I like you, too, Nathan.", "completion": "You do?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.", "completion": "It's just that I have some peculiarities, and..."}
{"prompt": "Yes, and...", "completion": "You really enjoy my company?"}
{"prompt": "It's only that I really enjoy your company and...", "completion": "You do?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry that I became so upset.", "completion": "No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas."}
{"prompt": "No biggie.", "completion": "Boy, this is good!"}
{"prompt": "Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.", "completion": "Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things."}
{"prompt": "My God! The fork! The fork!", "completion": "I'm sorry?"}
{"prompt": "You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...", "completion": "Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish..."}
{"prompt": "Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.", "completion": "It looks wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.", "completion": "We are animals after all."}
{"prompt": "The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.", "completion": "I'm not sure."}
{"prompt": "It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.", "completion": "Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?"}
{"prompt": "I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.", "completion": "What's the larger experiment?"}
{"prompt": "Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.", "completion": "Paper or cloth?"}
{"prompt": "Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.", "completion": "How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.", "completion": "I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan."}
{"prompt": "I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.", "completion": "You are a therapist, right?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.", "completion": "I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to."}
{"prompt": "Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.", "completion": "That's not necessarily a bad thing."}
{"prompt": "I have to say that I'm not there yet.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.", "completion": "You've got to respect that."}
{"prompt": "As do I.", "completion": "They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, \"Ewww. A slug.\""}
{"prompt": "Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.", "completion": "Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs."}
{"prompt": "You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.", "completion": "I have to talk. Is that okay?"}
{"prompt": "Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?", "completion": "Unka unka unka unka unka."}
{"prompt": "Puff, put the gun down.", "completion": "Ounpoo. Ungh."}
{"prompt": "Unn.", "completion": "Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur."}
{"prompt": "Ugnh.", "completion": "Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject."}
{"prompt": "Interesting.", "completion": "Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?"}
{"prompt": "And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.", "completion": "here, here."}
{"prompt": "Thanks to you, Nate.", "completion": "Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance."}
{"prompt": "Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.", "completion": "It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to..."}
{"prompt": "Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.", "completion": "Got it."}
{"prompt": "I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.", "completion": "Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you."}
{"prompt": "Free to come and go as you please. There's some \"mad money\" in the night table drawer.", "completion": "It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?"}
{"prompt": "Extra dessert?", "completion": "Even better."}
{"prompt": "Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!", "completion": "And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you."}
{"prompt": "Yahoo!", "completion": "Tomorrow, the acid test."}
{"prompt": "Lila?", "completion": "Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight."}
{"prompt": "Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.", "completion": "I bow to your expertise in these matters."}
{"prompt": "I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.", "completion": "I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem."}
{"prompt": "Okay. That's fair.", "completion": "This is great, Puff. You're doing fine."}
{"prompt": "Oh boy!", "completion": "Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case."}
{"prompt": "Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.", "completion": "Bravo, Puff! Bravo!"}
{"prompt": "I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?", "completion": "And how do you feel about Gabrielle?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.", "completion": "I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila."}
{"prompt": "No, why?", "completion": "Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair."}
{"prompt": "So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.", "completion": "Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?"}
{"prompt": "I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.", "completion": "I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Yes... Derek.", "completion": "It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever."}
{"prompt": "I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.", "completion": "Mother?"}
{"prompt": "Wait!", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "Huh?", "completion": "It's open...  What'll you have?"}
{"prompt": "Give me a bottle of beer.", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Check!", "completion": "You look different... More relaxed."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady."}
{"prompt": "Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.", "completion": "You want a chaser?"}
{"prompt": "About sixty, seventy bucks.", "completion": "Next game, ten bucks."}
{"prompt": "Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.", "completion": "Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?"}
{"prompt": "Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.", "completion": "What do you guys sell?"}
{"prompt": "Mm hmm.", "completion": "Comin' in or goin' out?"}
{"prompt": "Yep.", "completion": "Pittsburgh?"}
{"prompt": "Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.", "completion": "Boys just passing through?"}
{"prompt": "And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?", "completion": "All I want's the money."}
{"prompt": "Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?", "completion": "That's the way it's done."}
{"prompt": "In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?", "completion": "It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money."}
{"prompt": "Are you ready for another?", "completion": "Thank you."}
{"prompt": "How?", "completion": "You tell me."}
{"prompt": "Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.", "completion": "I'll make it up to you."}
{"prompt": "Well, nobody has to sell.", "completion": "You bastard."}
{"prompt": "All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.", "completion": "No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap."}
{"prompt": "For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.", "completion": "You didn't answer my first question. For whom?"}
{"prompt": "To win.", "completion": "For whom and for what?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.", "completion": "You know what's good for him?"}
{"prompt": "I want to talk to you.", "completion": "Do we need words?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.", "completion": "We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah."}
{"prompt": "And a fact is a fact.", "completion": "She's a smart girl, Eddie."}
{"prompt": "It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.", "completion": "That's right, Miss Packard."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?", "completion": "Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?"}
{"prompt": "What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?", "completion": "I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?"}
{"prompt": "I'm ready.", "completion": "Soon as I finish my coffee."}
{"prompt": "I've never been to Louisville.", "completion": "Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm fine.", "completion": "You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?"}
{"prompt": "Packard. Sarah Packard.", "completion": "It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?"}
{"prompt": "Twelve thousand.", "completion": "You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?"}
{"prompt": "Cash.", "completion": "How much do I owe you?"}
{"prompt": "The night is two thousand dollars old.", "completion": "Will you take a check, Bert?"}
{"prompt": "It's possible.", "completion": "That seems a shame. The night is young."}
{"prompt": "I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.", "completion": "Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist."}
{"prompt": "Do you really think you can beat him?", "completion": "Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?"}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "Oh, about five hundred."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.", "completion": "Deal the cards."}
{"prompt": "Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.", "completion": "You ever played billiards before?"}
{"prompt": "We'll be there.", "completion": "Good, good."}
{"prompt": "Could be.", "completion": "Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards."}
{"prompt": "If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.", "completion": "And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya."}
{"prompt": "Aaaahhhh!", "completion": "Boy, we really gave it to her good."}
{"prompt": "No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.", "completion": "We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.", "completion": "Fifty per cent?"}
{"prompt": "I'm a businessman, kid.", "completion": "Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?"}
{"prompt": "You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.", "completion": "So you figure you're still my manager, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Well, here it's half.", "completion": "What if I don't pay ya, Bert?"}
{"prompt": "Half.", "completion": "In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent."}
{"prompt": "Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!", "completion": "And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?"}
{"prompt": "Tell her what?", "completion": "You gotta be hard, Eddie."}
{"prompt": "I got time, Bert.", "completion": "You want me to tell her for you?"}
{"prompt": "I wanna walk.", "completion": "It's a long walk."}
{"prompt": "I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.", "completion": "What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now."}
{"prompt": "All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.", "completion": "Please don't get off me now."}
{"prompt": "I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.", "completion": "I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!", "completion": "I said we're leavin'."}
{"prompt": "They're fine.", "completion": "Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'."}
{"prompt": "I'll beat him the next game.", "completion": "How're the hands?"}
{"prompt": "I can beat him.", "completion": "All right. Five hundred."}
{"prompt": "Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?", "completion": "What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him."}
{"prompt": "'Bout even.", "completion": "When do I raise the bet?"}
{"prompt": "You hustlin' me?", "completion": "How do we stand?"}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "Sure."}
{"prompt": "Well, we won't.", "completion": "C'mon, Bert. Let me play him."}
{"prompt": "What's the matter? What happened?", "completion": "It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off."}
{"prompt": "So does Eddie.", "completion": "Well, I win sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?", "completion": "Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "Over there by the bar."}
{"prompt": "Come on, let's go...", "completion": "Hey, Findley's here."}
{"prompt": "Hey, whaddya say something like that for?", "completion": "You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes."}
{"prompt": "Fine.", "completion": "Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple."}
{"prompt": "I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.", "completion": "Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose."}
{"prompt": "No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.", "completion": "Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart."}
{"prompt": "Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.", "completion": "Here, I got it."}
{"prompt": "I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.", "completion": "What's that supposed to mean?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.", "completion": "You must have a lot of confidence in me."}
{"prompt": "He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.", "completion": "How good is he?"}
{"prompt": "James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.", "completion": "What? And he -- he hustles pool?"}
{"prompt": "Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.", "completion": "Miss Packard. How do you do?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.", "completion": "Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown."}
{"prompt": "I been thinking.", "completion": "Thinking about what?"}
{"prompt": "Like I told ya. My thumbs.", "completion": "No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs."}
{"prompt": "You name the place, boss. I'll be there.", "completion": "What happened to you anyway?"}
{"prompt": "Where do I sign?", "completion": "The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky."}
{"prompt": "Maybe you oughta give me lessons.", "completion": "Sign up."}
{"prompt": "You know everybody, don't you?", "completion": "Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.", "completion": "Man named Turk Baker?"}
{"prompt": "I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.", "completion": "What happened? Somebody step on your hands?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.", "completion": "Oh. You seem to do all right that way."}
{"prompt": "Hi. How's business?", "completion": "Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know when it was.", "completion": "Hello, Eddie."}
{"prompt": "Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.", "completion": "Now, when did you adopt me?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?", "completion": "There are places. I'll scuffle around."}
{"prompt": "No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.", "completion": "Kiss off."}
{"prompt": "I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.", "completion": "Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk."}
{"prompt": "Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.", "completion": "Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles."}
{"prompt": "I never saw you do anything else.", "completion": "You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars."}
{"prompt": "How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.", "completion": "You think I can lose?"}
{"prompt": "For me.", "completion": "That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?"}
{"prompt": "Seventy-five per cent.", "completion": "For who?"}
{"prompt": "Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.", "completion": "Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?"}
{"prompt": "Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.", "completion": "To do what?"}
{"prompt": "Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.", "completion": "Thanks for the drink."}
{"prompt": "First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.", "completion": "I told you. I got drunk."}
{"prompt": "Eddie, you're a born loser.", "completion": "What's that supposed to mean?"}
{"prompt": "Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?", "completion": "Whaddya been so far?"}
{"prompt": "See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.", "completion": "In that case, you owe me another drink."}
{"prompt": "No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.", "completion": "How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?", "completion": "A thousand."}
{"prompt": "That's your problem.", "completion": "So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character."}
{"prompt": "You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?", "completion": "Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?"}
{"prompt": "He drank as much whisky as you did.", "completion": "Maybe he knows how to drink."}
{"prompt": "You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.", "completion": "I got drunk."}
{"prompt": "Character.", "completion": "Yeah. Sure, sure."}
{"prompt": "I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.", "completion": "So I got talent. So what beat me?"}
{"prompt": "Pool.", "completion": "You being cute?"}
{"prompt": "Poker's not your game.", "completion": "What is?"}
{"prompt": "I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?", "completion": "I lost twenty bucks."}
{"prompt": "Only when I work.", "completion": "Yeah? Why?"}
{"prompt": "I'm buyin'.", "completion": "Thought you only drank milk."}
{"prompt": "Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.", "completion": "Two."}
{"prompt": "Cut.", "completion": "Deal."}
{"prompt": "Sit down.", "completion": "Make it twenty."}
{"prompt": "What did he say?", "completion": "Okay?"}
{"prompt": "Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.", "completion": "Stay with this kid. He's a loser."}
{"prompt": "Hey, mister.", "completion": "The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon."}
{"prompt": "Just tell me where I can find him, friend.", "completion": "Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you."}
{"prompt": "You got that wrong, mister. I am.", "completion": "Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend."}
{"prompt": "He's my partner.", "completion": "You well-heeled, partner?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, that's right.", "completion": "Want some free advice?"}
{"prompt": "The expensive kind.", "completion": "Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?", "completion": "What kind of straight pool game you like?"}
{"prompt": "You name it, we shoot it.", "completion": "Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me."}
{"prompt": "Who's he?", "completion": "What's your game? What do you shoot?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe. You want to play?", "completion": "No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?"}
{"prompt": "Just like that?", "completion": "Yeah. Just like that."}
{"prompt": "All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.", "completion": "Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you."}
{"prompt": "Is that what you think?", "completion": "Yeah, that's what I think."}
{"prompt": "You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?", "completion": "You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?"}
{"prompt": "What for? To play Fats again?", "completion": "Yeah, to play Fats again."}
{"prompt": "Aw, Eddie.", "completion": "C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money."}
{"prompt": "My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.", "completion": "Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie."}
{"prompt": "What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?", "completion": "HOW MUCH?!"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.", "completion": "Oh yeah? Where?"}
{"prompt": "He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.", "completion": "With what?"}
{"prompt": "This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?", "completion": "I told you you'd get your money back."}
{"prompt": "Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?", "completion": "Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation."}
{"prompt": "What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?", "completion": "I'll connect. I'll get you your money back."}
{"prompt": "I want you to come back on the road with me.", "completion": "Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, \"This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy.\"", "completion": "Talk to me, Charlie."}
{"prompt": "You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --", "completion": "A son."}
{"prompt": "How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.", "completion": "So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.", "completion": "Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you."}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah? How'd you find me?", "completion": "I asked around."}
{"prompt": "Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.", "completion": "Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you."}
{"prompt": "Is this all we got left?", "completion": "If that's all you got, that's all we got left."}
{"prompt": "Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.", "completion": "Okay, here...  Be a damn fool."}
{"prompt": "Go on home. Just leave me the money.", "completion": "Go to hell."}
{"prompt": "What are ya, chicken, Charlie?", "completion": "Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken."}
{"prompt": "Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.", "completion": "What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?"}
{"prompt": "Give me a drink, will ya?", "completion": "You don't need a drink."}
{"prompt": "You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?", "completion": "Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight."}
{"prompt": "Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?", "completion": "Get with what?"}

{"prompt": "Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.", "completion": "How do you feel?"}
{"prompt": "Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?", "completion": "Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you."}
{"prompt": "Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.", "completion": "I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie."}
{"prompt": "It's quiet.", "completion": "Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler."}
{"prompt": "Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.", "completion": "Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up."}
{"prompt": "I don't want it.", "completion": "Well... well, now."}
{"prompt": "Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.", "completion": "Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table."}
{"prompt": "You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.", "completion": "Whaddya mean?"}
{"prompt": "Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.", "completion": "Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before."}
{"prompt": "You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.", "completion": "I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before."}
{"prompt": "You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!", "completion": "Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?"}
{"prompt": "It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.", "completion": "Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue."}
{"prompt": "Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.", "completion": "Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself."}

{"prompt": "Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.", "completion": "For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now."}
{"prompt": "Okay?", "completion": "There it is. I'm broke."}
{"prompt": "Oh no, nothing for me.", "completion": "Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?"}
{"prompt": "I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.", "completion": "Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?"}
{"prompt": "By all means.", "completion": "I thought we came here to play pool."}
{"prompt": "You gentlemen care for a drink?", "completion": "No, none for me. Come on, let's play."}
{"prompt": "What time?", "completion": "I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play."}
{"prompt": "That's right. When?", "completion": "Would you like to come out tonight?"}
{"prompt": "When?", "completion": "You're very direct, Mr. Felson."}
{"prompt": "How much?", "completion": "Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition."}
{"prompt": "A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.", "completion": "I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do."}
{"prompt": "And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?", "completion": "Now and then. Why, do you?"}
{"prompt": "Findley.", "completion": "Glad to meet you."}
{"prompt": "No, no more for me.", "completion": "Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time."}
{"prompt": "Gimme ten bucks.", "completion": "Ten dollars."}
{"prompt": "What's the limit?", "completion": "Half and a dollar."}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.", "completion": "Oh man, you're way out of our league."}
{"prompt": "Who's he?", "completion": "Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night."}
{"prompt": "Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?", "completion": "Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "You quittin', friend?", "completion": "Yeah, I'm quittin'."}
{"prompt": "You better not miss, friend.", "completion": "I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat."}
{"prompt": "Call it.", "completion": "Heads."}
{"prompt": "Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.", "completion": "Okay, friend. You're on."}
{"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "You sure you don't want to quit, friend?"}
{"prompt": "Try me.", "completion": "Shoot."}
{"prompt": "You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?", "completion": "You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler."}
{"prompt": "I guess it's just you and me, huh?", "completion": "Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me."}
{"prompt": "How much are you ahead?", "completion": "Couple of bucks."}
{"prompt": "You quittin' too?", "completion": "You're a pretty good player."}

{"prompt": "How much you playin' for?", "completion": "A dollar on the five, two on the nine."}
{"prompt": "Hi.", "completion": "Hi."}
{"prompt": "Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.", "completion": "Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!"}
{"prompt": "Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.", "completion": "Shut up."}
{"prompt": "Please, Eddie, don't beg him.", "completion": "Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel."}
{"prompt": "I'm a little tired.", "completion": "Go on back to the hotel."}
{"prompt": "If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.", "completion": "Well, what's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Just for luck."}
{"prompt": "He went off someplace.", "completion": "Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it."}
{"prompt": "I'll be up later.", "completion": "Where's Bert?"}
{"prompt": "No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.", "completion": "Fifty-seven."}
{"prompt": "I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.", "completion": "Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?"}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?", "completion": "I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street."}
{"prompt": "If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.", "completion": "Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it."}
{"prompt": "Why should I?", "completion": "Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back."}
{"prompt": "Leave now.", "completion": "Oh, grow up."}
{"prompt": "No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.", "completion": "I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning."}
{"prompt": "Come here. Come on, now.", "completion": "Don't you want to know where I'm going?"}
{"prompt": "Sure. Let's go home.", "completion": "No, I want to walk."}
{"prompt": "A week? A year?", "completion": "More like a week. Look, I'll be back."}
{"prompt": "For how long?", "completion": "Oh, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "What do you want to tell me?", "completion": "Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while."}
{"prompt": "What is it, Eddie?", "completion": "Nothin'.  Want another drink?"}
{"prompt": "Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.", "completion": "First time for everything."}
{"prompt": "I feel pretty.", "completion": "Well, what's so funny?"}
{"prompt": "Sherry.  Very old, very dry.", "completion": "Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty."}
{"prompt": "You glad?", "completion": "Yes, I'm glad."}
{"prompt": "You need the words?", "completion": "Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back."}
{"prompt": "You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.", "completion": "I love you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.", "completion": "You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie."}
{"prompt": "Well, what else does?", "completion": "Does it bother you? What he said?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he owns things.", "completion": "Is that what makes a winner?"}
{"prompt": "He's a gambler.", "completion": "Is he a winner?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.", "completion": "What does he do, this Bert Gordon?"}
{"prompt": "He knows. A lot.", "completion": "Why did he tell you?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.", "completion": "Would he know?"}
{"prompt": "Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?", "completion": "A loser?"}
{"prompt": "No. You?", "completion": "What's it so hot in here for?"}
{"prompt": "You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?", "completion": "You wanna drink?"}
{"prompt": "What happened?", "completion": "I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs."}
{"prompt": "Who is it?", "completion": "Me. It's Eddie."}
{"prompt": "You'll find yourself another rich old lover.", "completion": "That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me."}
{"prompt": "What's this supposed to mean: \"We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down.\"", "completion": "You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?"}
{"prompt": "What's this supposed to mean?", "completion": "Give it back to me."}
{"prompt": "Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.", "completion": "Give it to me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. For a little while.", "completion": "What are you writing?"}
{"prompt": "No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?", "completion": "You going out?"}
{"prompt": "From a rich old man who used to be my lover.", "completion": "Do you want me to go?"}
{"prompt": "No, why should I? It's yours.", "completion": "It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?"}
{"prompt": "Eddie, what's in that case?", "completion": "Haven't you opened it?"}
{"prompt": "I've got something in my bag.", "completion": "Oh, it's not bad."}
{"prompt": "Raw.", "completion": "Oh, cut my finger."}
{"prompt": "Don't you ever cook anything?", "completion": "Eggs. How do you like them?"}
{"prompt": "No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.", "completion": "The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted."}
{"prompt": "What did all this stuff cost you?", "completion": "When you've got money, you'll pay."}
{"prompt": "I'm hungry.", "completion": "Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday."}
{"prompt": "Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.", "completion": "I'm getting treatments right here."}
{"prompt": "You got it all in your head?", "completion": "When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up."}
{"prompt": "What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?", "completion": "Mm hmm."}
{"prompt": "Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.", "completion": "You want to go with me?"}
{"prompt": "Eddie, where do you go when you go out?", "completion": "Museums... art galleries... concerts."}
{"prompt": "You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, \"Listen, I got a fella.\"", "completion": "Thanks."}
{"prompt": "You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?", "completion": "Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours."}
{"prompt": "At school. It's Thursday.", "completion": "Oh, I forgot."}
{"prompt": "Well, what do you want to know? And why?", "completion": "Where you been all day?"}
{"prompt": "I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.", "completion": "I'm not sure... I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Okay. So what's your name today?", "completion": "Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone."}
{"prompt": "You told me.", "completion": "I lied. When I'm drunk I lie."}
{"prompt": "What did you say that for, Sarah?", "completion": "How did you know my name was Sarah?"}
{"prompt": "Come here.", "completion": "Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house."}
{"prompt": "Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.", "completion": "Why?"}
{"prompt": "Give me a drag.", "completion": "What time is it?"}
{"prompt": "I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.", "completion": "A day like any other. People come, people go."}
{"prompt": "No. I'll take you home.", "completion": "Why did you do that?"}
{"prompt": "Fifth of scotch?", "completion": "What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?"}
{"prompt": "I could always get us a bottle.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.", "completion": "I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?"}
{"prompt": "Eddie. The name is Eddie.", "completion": "The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?"}
{"prompt": "Hey!", "completion": "No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?"}
{"prompt": "What do you do on the other days?", "completion": "I drink."}
{"prompt": "So why go to college?", "completion": "I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays."}
{"prompt": "No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.", "completion": "I'm not."}
{"prompt": "You don't look like a college girl.", "completion": "I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated."}
{"prompt": "Yeah? What do you do now?", "completion": "I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college."}
{"prompt": "You talk kind of funny, but I like it.", "completion": "I used to be an actress."}
{"prompt": "No, not always.", "completion": "Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?"}
{"prompt": "Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?", "completion": "Do you always ask so many questions?"}
{"prompt": "Around.", "completion": "I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?"}
{"prompt": "Then why go to the bus station?", "completion": "Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?"}
{"prompt": "How come you didn't catch your bus?", "completion": "I wasn't waiting for a bus."}
{"prompt": "Can I buy you another drink?", "completion": "It's the lights. And the scotch."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.", "completion": "Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast."}
{"prompt": "Can I sit down?", "completion": "Why not? We already know each other's secrets."}
{"prompt": "Have a nice trip?", "completion": "Fair."}
{"prompt": "Have a nice trip.", "completion": "Thanks. I will."}
{"prompt": "That wouldn't give us much time, would it?", "completion": "Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't."}
{"prompt": "Yours.", "completion": "Eight o'clock."}
{"prompt": "What time does the bus leave?", "completion": "What bus?"}
{"prompt": "Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?", "completion": "Fine, thanks."}
{"prompt": "How long have you been waiting?", "completion": "Since four."}
{"prompt": "How long you been waiting?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Long wait for a bus?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "...you shoot a great game of pool.", "completion": "So do you, Fast Eddie."}

{"prompt": "Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.", "completion": "Let's go."}

{"prompt": "That is not now, human!", "completion": "My name is Robert."}
{"prompt": "I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --", "completion": "You lived like this once."}
{"prompt": "You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?", "completion": "Stay alive."}
{"prompt": "Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?", "completion": "They are... sinister.  They want to kill me."}
{"prompt": "That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?", "completion": "Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful."}
{"prompt": "Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?", "completion": "Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle."}
{"prompt": "Virginia...?", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.", "completion": "The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --"}
{"prompt": "Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.", "completion": "It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?", "completion": "I surrender --"}
{"prompt": "It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.", "completion": "You and that damned garden."}
{"prompt": "I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Bathroom?", "completion": "Round back."}
{"prompt": "You built things.", "completion": "I guess you could say that."}
{"prompt": "So, what do you do?", "completion": "I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --"}
{"prompt": "Hell of a night.", "completion": "You got that right."}
{"prompt": "Only got one kind.", "completion": "That's fine."}
{"prompt": "Need some gas?", "completion": "Please."}
{"prompt": "I was so scared.", "completion": "Better now, son?"}
{"prompt": "It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...", "completion": "I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon."}
{"prompt": "That's a doozy of a dream, son.", "completion": "It was so real, Dad."}
{"prompt": "First lemme look at your necks.", "completion": "... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up."}
{"prompt": "I had an awful dream.", "completion": "What, Jim, what?"}
{"prompt": "I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.", "completion": "Was there anything over the hill?"}
{"prompt": "Are you all right, Dad?", "completion": "Sure ... fine."}
{"prompt": "I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.", "completion": "I'll go take a look when the rain lets off."}
{"prompt": "It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.", "completion": "Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --"}
{"prompt": "It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.", "completion": "What did it look like?"}
{"prompt": "Jim -- what's wrong?!", "completion": "You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!"}
{"prompt": "Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.", "completion": "Okay."}
{"prompt": "Which one's that?  The dull, red one.", "completion": "That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky."}
{"prompt": "... and Rigel.", "completion": "And that one -- to the right of Rigel?"}
{"prompt": "This should be the heaviest shower of the year.", "completion": "There's Cassius ..."}
{"prompt": "Because the sky is so clear out here.", "completion": "There are more this year than last."}
{"prompt": "It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.", "completion": "Why, Dad?"}
{"prompt": "Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.", "completion": "A meteorite, Dad, look!"}
{"prompt": "Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.", "completion": "It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here."}
{"prompt": "If we want it, it is.", "completion": "Let's check it out, Dad."}
{"prompt": "This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?", "completion": "Is the hill ours too?"}
{"prompt": "That's the Air Force Base.", "completion": "Wow.  Look at the mountains."}
{"prompt": "You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.", "completion": "What's that, Dad?"}
{"prompt": "I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.", "completion": "I'll have to go to a new school -- again."}
{"prompt": "We're going to be moving, son.", "completion": "Do we have to?"}
{"prompt": "Son ... are you awake?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.", "completion": "Good night."}
{"prompt": "What's wrong, Ellen?", "completion": "It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill."}
{"prompt": "You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.", "completion": "George, you're acting very strangely."}
{"prompt": "I'm home now.", "completion": "Yes -- but ..."}
{"prompt": "I left it at work.", "completion": "You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried."}
{"prompt": "That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.", "completion": "Where's your car?"}
{"prompt": "I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?", "completion": "What happened to you?  Who was that?"}
{"prompt": "You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.", "completion": "It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong."}
{"prompt": "I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.", "completion": "I'll take you to school."}
{"prompt": "Is that all he said?", "completion": "Why, yes.  Why?"}
{"prompt": "What did he talk to you about?", "completion": "He was upset with moving, I believe."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?", "completion": "I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone."}
{"prompt": "We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.", "completion": "Yes, Mr. Gardner."}
{"prompt": "I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.", "completion": "Of course."}
{"prompt": "You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?", "completion": "Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter."}
{"prompt": "I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?", "completion": "Mr. Gardner, I --"}
{"prompt": "About what?", "completion": "Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school."}
{"prompt": "May I ask why?", "completion": "We were having a little talk."}
{"prompt": "I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.", "completion": "Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner."}
{"prompt": "They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.", "completion": "Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking."}
{"prompt": "Let's try.", "completion": "You're looking for life?"}
{"prompt": "We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.", "completion": "There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something."}
{"prompt": "Don't go in.", "completion": "I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town."}
{"prompt": "But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...", "completion": "Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore."}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --"}
{"prompt": "Damn.", "completion": "I know a way."}
{"prompt": "No one comes here after dark.", "completion": "Hide the car."}
{"prompt": "Did you call the State Police?", "completion": "All their lines were busy."}
{"prompt": "Who are you calling?", "completion": "The State Police."}
{"prompt": "Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.", "completion": "Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call."}
{"prompt": "We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?", "completion": "Does it look to you like anything landed here?"}
{"prompt": "Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.", "completion": "They'll get us."}
{"prompt": "But it's not, Jimmy.", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "No, but it was here.", "completion": "I swear it was here."}
{"prompt": "This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.", "completion": "I don't see anything."}
{"prompt": "Behind my house, up on the ridge.", "completion": "If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind."}
{"prompt": "I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.", "completion": "Where, Jimmy?"}
{"prompt": "This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.", "completion": "Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!"}
{"prompt": "Do you know how to follow a map?", "completion": "Yes.  I can even read star maps."}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "'Cause he wouldn't lie."}
{"prompt": "What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?", "completion": "I'd believe him."}
{"prompt": "How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?", "completion": "She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too."}
{"prompt": "Can you tell me about that?", "completion": "That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?", "completion": "I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving."}
{"prompt": "This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "What kind, Mom?", "completion": "Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed."}
{"prompt": "I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.", "completion": "It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself."}
{"prompt": "This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.", "completion": "I have school."}
{"prompt": "Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.", "completion": "When?"}
{"prompt": "Mom.  I gotta talk to you.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Hi.  Sorry I'm late.", "completion": "The back door was open."}
{"prompt": "Your father asked you a question.", "completion": "What? -- I..."}
{"prompt": "George, where have you been?", "completion": "What happened to your other slipper?"}
{"prompt": "What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?", "completion": "No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane."}
{"prompt": "Mom -- this is the best show all year.", "completion": "I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too."}
{"prompt": "All right.  I'll be right back.", "completion": "Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed."}
{"prompt": "Why, yes.", "completion": "Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call."}
{"prompt": "They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.", "completion": "Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?"}
{"prompt": "Oh?", "completion": "What's his family background?"}
{"prompt": "Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?", "completion": "His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him."}
{"prompt": "If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.", "completion": "What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?"}
{"prompt": "Cool.", "completion": "This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could do more but we're moving out.", "completion": "We're going with you. I mean, we're going too."}
{"prompt": "Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.", "completion": "It's really nice of you to help us."}
{"prompt": "Did it work?", "completion": "You bet it did."}
{"prompt": "If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?", "completion": "Are you all right?"}
{"prompt": "We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.", "completion": "With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?"}
{"prompt": "I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?", "completion": "Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?"}
{"prompt": "He's a good man.", "completion": "Better be. You left me for him."}
{"prompt": "A toast to the end of the world.", "completion": "You still believe in him."}
{"prompt": "Just my luck, no ice.", "completion": "I take it you've heard."}
{"prompt": "You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?", "completion": "David, don't..."}
{"prompt": "I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.", "completion": "He's not going to listen to me."}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to do?", "completion": "I want you to leave with us. Right now."}
{"prompt": "And when is the countdown supposed to expire?", "completion": "Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds."}
{"prompt": "David? How'd you get this number?", "completion": "Walk to the window. Right in front of you."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Connie, don't hang up."}
{"prompt": "You're being paranoid.", "completion": "It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked..."}
{"prompt": "In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.", "completion": "I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack..."}
{"prompt": "This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.", "completion": "You don't understand. You have to leave Washington."}
{"prompt": "What do you want?", "completion": "You have to leave the White House."}
{"prompt": "Love was never our problem.", "completion": "All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad."}
{"prompt": "Spunky. He told you about that?", "completion": "All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think."}
{"prompt": "He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.", "completion": "Think nothing of it, Spanky."}
{"prompt": "Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.", "completion": "My ex-husband works in satellite communications."}
{"prompt": "David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.", "completion": "Punched the President? Oh my god."}
{"prompt": "We're losing them.", "completion": "Then get them out of there."}
{"prompt": "You saved a lot of lives.", "completion": "I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?"}
{"prompt": "He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.", "completion": "I'll bet."}
{"prompt": "More than likely.", "completion": "I don't know how you put up with him."}
{"prompt": "Checkmate.", "completion": "Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?"}
{"prompt": "Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.", "completion": "Then what?"}
{"prompt": "That signal. It's a countdown.", "completion": "A countdown to what?"}
{"prompt": "Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.", "completion": "Not really..."}
{"prompt": "Just do it!", "completion": "Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?"}
{"prompt": "Tell her to get the kids and leave town.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "What're you talking about?", "completion": "Haven't you been watching?"}
{"prompt": "Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?", "completion": "Can you believe this?"}
{"prompt": "I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.", "completion": "Huh? Oh, good, good."}
{"prompt": "Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...", "completion": "...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man."}
{"prompt": "No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.", "completion": "That's the good news?"}
{"prompt": "You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.", "completion": "And the good news is you won't charge me."}
{"prompt": "There's good news and bad news.", "completion": "What's the bad news?"}
{"prompt": "Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.", "completion": "We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there."}
{"prompt": "Did you try to switch to transponder channels?", "completion": "Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?"}
{"prompt": "What the hell is this?", "completion": "So sue me."}
{"prompt": "It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?", "completion": "Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on."}
{"prompt": "I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.", "completion": "What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?"}
{"prompt": "A cold? Of course.", "completion": "Thanks, Pops."}
{"prompt": "Pops, you're a genius!", "completion": "What'd I say?"}
{"prompt": "We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.", "completion": "David, you're drunk."}
{"prompt": "I'm making a mess.", "completion": "This I can see."}
{"prompt": "What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!", "completion": "David, David! What the hell are you doing!?"}
{"prompt": "Moishe, please, don't talk.", "completion": "Dad, please..."}
{"prompt": "He wasn't the President then.", "completion": "It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?"}
{"prompt": "Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.", "completion": "You punched the President in the face?"}
{"prompt": "You can do that?", "completion": "Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?"}
{"prompt": "It's perfect the line is busy?", "completion": "Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House."}
{"prompt": "She didn't take my name when we were married.", "completion": "Perfect, she's using it."}
{"prompt": "College nickname.", "completion": "You try Martin?"}
{"prompt": "I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...", "completion": "Spunky?"}
{"prompt": "She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...", "completion": "Not listed, huh?"}
{"prompt": "This, pops, is every phone book in America.", "completion": "You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?"}
{"prompt": "All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.", "completion": "What the hell is that?"}
{"prompt": "And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?", "completion": "Dad..."}
{"prompt": "You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.", "completion": "They don't know this."}
{"prompt": "It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.", "completion": "Can't this thing go any faster?"}
{"prompt": "You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.", "completion": "That's okay. You're driving."}
{"prompt": "The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.", "completion": "You still got the Olds?"}
{"prompt": "Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.", "completion": "Pops!"}
{"prompt": "I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.", "completion": "Three years."}
{"prompt": "David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...", "completion": "Dad, don't start."}
{"prompt": "You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?", "completion": "You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose."}
{"prompt": "I'm thinking.", "completion": "So think already."}
{"prompt": "I don't hear no fat lady.", "completion": "What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there."}
{"prompt": "We're loose!", "completion": "Doesn't matter. Game's over."}
{"prompt": "Nice meeting you.", "completion": "You as well."}
{"prompt": "What're you doing?", "completion": "It's not me. They're overriding the system."}
{"prompt": "Get us out of here!", "completion": "I can't shake her free."}
{"prompt": "Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?", "completion": "Looks like they're preparing the invasion."}
{"prompt": "What the hell are you doing?", "completion": "Just getting a feel for her."}
{"prompt": "I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.", "completion": "Great."}
{"prompt": "Oh shit, we're late.", "completion": "We'll meet you there."}
{"prompt": "Roger.", "completion": "I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter."}
{"prompt": "I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.", "completion": "Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered."}
{"prompt": "Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.", "completion": "Where's it headed?"}
{"prompt": "I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.", "completion": "Grey, you read me?"}
{"prompt": "Then find them.", "completion": "Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?"}
{"prompt": "But what, General?", "completion": "Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air."}
{"prompt": "And our troops here?", "completion": "We've been collecting planes from all over but..."}
{"prompt": "Better than we thought.", "completion": "We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Sir.", "completion": "How're we doing?"}
{"prompt": "We're being exterminated.", "completion": "Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them."}
{"prompt": "And our forces?", "completion": "We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours."}
{"prompt": "Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?", "completion": "And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis."}
{"prompt": "Where are they?", "completion": "ETA with target; four minutes."}
{"prompt": "Any news on my wife?", "completion": "The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact."}
{"prompt": "Is my wife in the air?", "completion": "She should be shortly."}
{"prompt": "But Mr. President...", "completion": "And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately."}
{"prompt": "Then God help us.", "completion": "General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can."}
{"prompt": "I had a feeling you would.", "completion": "Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?"}
{"prompt": "Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.", "completion": "With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side."}
{"prompt": "How long would their shields be down?", "completion": "With their shields down it might be possible."}
{"prompt": "Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!", "completion": "This is ridiculous."}
{"prompt": "You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?", "completion": "It had been deemed classified."}
{"prompt": "My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...", "completion": "Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!"}
{"prompt": "We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.", "completion": "That's impossible..."}
{"prompt": "More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.", "completion": "This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!"}
{"prompt": "Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.", "completion": "Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately."}
{"prompt": "Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.", "completion": "That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki."}
{"prompt": "It's doing what?", "completion": "It's... slowing down, Sir."}
{"prompt": "How do you know?", "completion": "Well, er... it's slowing down."}
{"prompt": "A meteor?", "completion": "No Sir. Definitely not."}
{"prompt": "Dick-weed.", "completion": "Butt-munch."}
{"prompt": "You scared the hell out of me.", "completion": "Yeah, but what an entrance!"}
{"prompt": "Sorry for what?", "completion": "I should have done this a long long time ago."}
{"prompt": "I know, you like to make a big entrance.", "completion": "Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "You're late.", "completion": "You know me..."}
{"prompt": "You're late.", "completion": "You know how I like to make a big entrance."}

{"prompt": "Be careful.", "completion": "Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base."}
{"prompt": "Wait. I have to tell you something.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "You said you were on leave for the Fourth.", "completion": "They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?"}
{"prompt": "You can't go. Call them back.", "completion": "Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away."}
{"prompt": "He's trying to impress you.", "completion": "He's doing a good job."}
{"prompt": "I thought you didn't recognize me.", "completion": "Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy."}
{"prompt": "Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.", "completion": "Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady."}
{"prompt": "Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.", "completion": "And when the dancing's over? What about your future?"}
{"prompt": "No. Exotic.", "completion": "Oh. Sorry."}
{"prompt": "I'm a dancer.", "completion": "Really? Ballet?"}
{"prompt": "He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.", "completion": "So, what do you do for a living?"}
{"prompt": "He's my angel.", "completion": "Was his father stationed here?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy, stay with me.", "completion": "Your son."}
{"prompt": "So push it!", "completion": "Stevie... I can't..."}
{"prompt": "Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.", "completion": "We're already over Mach 2!"}
{"prompt": "I didn't even see them fire!", "completion": "Command, Eagle One. Switching to \"sidewinders.\" We're moving in."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.", "completion": "Damn it!"}
{"prompt": "I hear you.", "completion": "I shouldn't have left her."}
{"prompt": "That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.", "completion": "Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings."}
{"prompt": "Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...", "completion": "I thought you said you were doing to break it off."}
{"prompt": "I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?", "completion": "How to kiss ass."}
{"prompt": "But I gave you some this morning.", "completion": "I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?", "completion": "That'd be cool!"}
{"prompt": "Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.", "completion": "He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?"}
{"prompt": "You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.", "completion": "I don't need it."}
{"prompt": "Stop it.", "completion": "It's all fuzzy."}
{"prompt": "How' he doing?", "completion": "Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?"}
{"prompt": "We should leave too.", "completion": "There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them."}
{"prompt": "For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?", "completion": "I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way."}
{"prompt": "You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.", "completion": "Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me."}
{"prompt": "Just what the hell do you think you're doing?", "completion": "We're leaving, don't try and stop us."}
{"prompt": "Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?", "completion": "They let you out?"}
{"prompt": "It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.", "completion": "You sure?"}
{"prompt": "Just what the hell do you think you're doing?", "completion": "I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself."}
{"prompt": "The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...", "completion": "I said call them back."}
{"prompt": "Deploy.", "completion": "Call them back."}
{"prompt": "Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.", "completion": "Mr. President?"}
{"prompt": "If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.", "completion": "Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?"}
{"prompt": "I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.", "completion": "Above American soil?"}
{"prompt": "What the hell's going on?", "completion": "We're leaving."}
{"prompt": "But, Mr. President...", "completion": "So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover."}
{"prompt": "We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...", "completion": "I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives."}
{"prompt": "These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.", "completion": "I'm not leaving."}
{"prompt": "Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?", "completion": "Can they be killed?"}
{"prompt": "People are dying out there. I don't think \"exciting\" is the word I'd choose to describe it!", "completion": "What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.", "completion": "See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!"}
{"prompt": "Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "What do you want us to do?", "completion": "Die."}
{"prompt": "Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?", "completion": "Peace? No peace."}

{"prompt": "Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!", "completion": "Did you say...? Uh, uh..."}
{"prompt": "Papers, sir. Got it here.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "There is no museum in Iskenderun.", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "And I am his.", "completion": "My reputation precedes me."}
{"prompt": "Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...", "completion": "Oh, what?... your servant, sir."}
{"prompt": "Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?", "completion": "Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.", "completion": "You are on your own?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, Sallah! What a relief!", "completion": "Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?"}
{"prompt": "Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!", "completion": "It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God."}
{"prompt": "What about you?", "completion": "I'm going after Dad."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Now we know.", "completion": "Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun."}
{"prompt": "Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.", "completion": "Alexandretta. Now we know."}
{"prompt": "The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. \"Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.\"  But where exactly?", "completion": "Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map."}
{"prompt": "How's the head?", "completion": "It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. \"Alexandretta?\" Hmmm..."}
{"prompt": "Dad was onto something here!", "completion": "Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean."}
{"prompt": "Where?", "completion": "Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!"}
{"prompt": "It looks like a converted church.", "completion": "Marcus -- I've seen this window before."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.", "completion": "That doesn't look much like a library."}
{"prompt": "Ah, Venice...", "completion": "Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?"}
{"prompt": "Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.", "completion": "I'll tell him we'll take two."}
{"prompt": "The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.", "completion": "But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith."}
{"prompt": "Do you believe, Marcus?", "completion": "Do you believe the Grail actually exists?"}
{"prompt": "It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?", "completion": "I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly."}
{"prompt": "Venice, Italy!", "completion": "What is it?"}
{"prompt": "Dad?", "completion": "It's today's mail. And it's been opened."}
{"prompt": "What has the old fool got himself into now?", "completion": "I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!"}
{"prompt": "Your treat.", "completion": "Yes. My treat."}
{"prompt": "All my life!", "completion": "Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection."}
{"prompt": "You know how long I've been looking for that?!", "completion": "All your life."}
{"prompt": "Marcus!  I did it!", "completion": "You've got it!"}
{"prompt": "Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!", "completion": "Got lost in his own museum, huh?"}
{"prompt": "No, Henry. Try not to talk.", "completion": "The Name of God..."}
{"prompt": "It's war.", "completion": "The Word of God..."}
{"prompt": "But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.", "completion": "Look what you did!"}
{"prompt": "Henry, the pen --", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Henry! What are you doing here?!", "completion": "It's a rescue, old boy. Come on."}
{"prompt": "Marcus!", "completion": "Arghhh! Oh!"}
{"prompt": "Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.", "completion": "You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend."}
{"prompt": "Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?", "completion": "I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit..."}
{"prompt": "I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.", "completion": "Oh, well. That's good. Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.", "completion": "Schneider?"}
{"prompt": "How dare he?!", "completion": "Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?"}
{"prompt": "Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?", "completion": "This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse."}
{"prompt": "Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.", "completion": "Tapestries?"}
{"prompt": "We're through!", "completion": "Are you expected?"}
{"prompt": "You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.", "completion": "I'm through!"}
{"prompt": "Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.", "completion": "Shooting me won't get you anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?", "completion": "As what? A Nazi stooge like you?"}
{"prompt": "DONOVAN!", "completion": "Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?"}
{"prompt": "You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?", "completion": "We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared."}
{"prompt": "Yes?", "completion": "We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail."}
{"prompt": "That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.", "completion": "You could be more right than you know."}
{"prompt": "Not \"supposedly,\" Doctor Jones.", "completion": "This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two \"markers\" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those \"markers.\" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second \"marker\" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away."}
{"prompt": "Let me tell you another \"bedtime story,\" Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.", "completion": "I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think."}
{"prompt": "What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.", "completion": "Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway."}
{"prompt": "Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.", "completion": "Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!"}
{"prompt": "Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!", "completion": "An old man's dream."}
{"prompt": "The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.", "completion": "The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before."}
{"prompt": "My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?", "completion": "\"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.\""}
{"prompt": "That was our assessment as well.", "completion": "Where did this come from?"}
{"prompt": "Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.", "completion": "Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think."}
{"prompt": "My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.", "completion": "I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive."}
{"prompt": "Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.", "completion": "I can reach it. I can reach it..."}
{"prompt": "It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.", "completion": "Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here."}
{"prompt": "I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.", "completion": "Elsa! Elsa, don't move!"}
{"prompt": "All I have to do is scream.", "completion": "I never expected to see you again."}
{"prompt": "You do.", "completion": "All I have to do is squeeze."}
{"prompt": "Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.", "completion": "Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?"}
{"prompt": "You came back for the book? Why?", "completion": "My father didn't want it incinerated."}
{"prompt": "How did you get here?", "completion": "Where is it? I want it."}
{"prompt": "This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.", "completion": "So it did."}
{"prompt": "This one. I think he's in here.", "completion": "How do you know?"}
{"prompt": "What are you going to do?", "completion": "Don't know. Think of something."}
{"prompt": "What do you know about this place?", "completion": "I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors."}
{"prompt": "No. You like the way I do things.", "completion": "It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier."}
{"prompt": "Knock it off. You're not mad.", "completion": "No?"}
{"prompt": "At least I let you tag along.", "completion": "Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.", "completion": "You had it? You didn't trust me!"}
{"prompt": "This.", "completion": "The Grail Diary."}
{"prompt": "Mine, too.", "completion": "What were they looking for?"}
{"prompt": "I said don't go between them!", "completion": "My room!"}
{"prompt": "I said go around!", "completion": "You said go between them!"}
{"prompt": "Don't wander off.", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?", "completion": "He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!"}
{"prompt": "What's that?", "completion": "It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet."}
{"prompt": "It must be one of these...", "completion": "Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork."}
{"prompt": "Are you sure?", "completion": "Pretty sure."}
{"prompt": "The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.", "completion": "The Ark of the Covenant."}
{"prompt": "Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.", "completion": "Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades."}
{"prompt": "Except he's lost, and I'm not.", "completion": "Lower me down."}
{"prompt": "Bingo.", "completion": "You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father."}
{"prompt": "My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.", "completion": "Find something?"}
{"prompt": "But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.", "completion": "Tomorrow I'll steal you another."}
{"prompt": "In that case, I permit you.", "completion": "It would make me very happy."}
{"prompt": "I usually don't.", "completion": "I usually don't either."}
{"prompt": "Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!", "completion": "Fraulein -- will you permit me?"}
{"prompt": "Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.", "completion": "The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy."}
{"prompt": "I knew it was you --", "completion": "And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you."}
{"prompt": "Doctor Jones?", "completion": "Yes?"}
{"prompt": "After you, Junior.", "completion": "Yes, sir!  Haaa!"}
{"prompt": "Ready.", "completion": "Uh-huh."}
{"prompt": "We named the dog Indiana.", "completion": "Ready?"}
{"prompt": "Junior?! Dad...", "completion": "I like Indiana."}
{"prompt": "Me?... Illumination.", "completion": "What did you find, Junior?"}
{"prompt": "Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.", "completion": "What did you find, Dad?"}
{"prompt": "Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!", "completion": "I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad."}
{"prompt": "But in the Latin alphabet, \"Jehovah\" begins with an \"I\".", "completion": "\"J\"."}
{"prompt": "Penitent. Penitent...", "completion": "The penitent man is humble..."}
{"prompt": "The penitent man. The penitent...", "completion": "The penitent man is humble before God."}
{"prompt": "\"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.\"", "completion": "The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man..."}
{"prompt": "Dad?!", "completion": "Junior..."}
{"prompt": "You call this archaeology?", "completion": "Get out of there, Dad!"}
{"prompt": "Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.", "completion": "Dad?"}
{"prompt": "Dad, we're well out of range.", "completion": "Now, who are all these people?"}
{"prompt": "This could be close.", "completion": "What do you think you're doing?! Get down!"}
{"prompt": "It happens to me all the time.", "completion": "This is intolerable!"}
{"prompt": "I know, Dad!", "completion": "It's a new experience for me."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.", "completion": "Those people are trying to kill us!"}
{"prompt": "More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.", "completion": "Nice landing."}
{"prompt": "What happens at eleven o'clock?", "completion": "Dad, are we hit?!"}
{"prompt": "Fly... yes. Land... no.", "completion": "Dad -- eleven o'clock!!"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. We'll find out.", "completion": "I didn't know you could fly a plane."}
{"prompt": "Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  \"First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth.\"", "completion": "What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "Very well. I'm here now.", "completion": "Well... I can't think of anything."}
{"prompt": "You left just when you were becoming interesting.", "completion": "Dad, how can you?"}
{"prompt": "Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.", "completion": "What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years."}
{"prompt": "Actually, I was a wonderful father.", "completion": "When?"}
{"prompt": "And do I detect a rebuke?", "completion": "A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that."}
{"prompt": "Hmmm... What did we talk about?", "completion": "We didn't talk. We never talked."}
{"prompt": "Ships that pass in the night...", "completion": "Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake."}
{"prompt": "Well, I'm as human as the next man.", "completion": "I was the next man."}
{"prompt": "You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.", "completion": "That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!"}
{"prompt": "When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.", "completion": "Relax."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.", "completion": "Good."}
{"prompt": "Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.", "completion": "What did you get?"}
{"prompt": "That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?", "completion": "This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom."}
{"prompt": "Marcus would agree with me.", "completion": "Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.", "completion": "What about Marcus?"}
{"prompt": "I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.", "completion": "Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.", "completion": "But what are they? Can't you remember?"}
{"prompt": "Three devices of such lethal cunning.", "completion": "Booby traps?"}
{"prompt": "Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.", "completion": "What final challenge?"}
{"prompt": "There is more in the Diary than just the map.", "completion": "All right Dad -- tell me."}
{"prompt": "My Diary's in Berlin.", "completion": "You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map."}
{"prompt": "You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!", "completion": "Brody's this way."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Stop! Stop!"}
{"prompt": "What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?", "completion": "Stop!"}
{"prompt": "...the solution presents itself.", "completion": "Come on, Dad. Come on!"}
{"prompt": "I'm out, Dad!", "completion": "Dad!"}
{"prompt": "Oh.", "completion": "This is intolerable!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Head for the fireplace!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Dad!"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Dad!"}
{"prompt": "All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.", "completion": "Dad!"}
{"prompt": "What???", "completion": "And the chair."}
{"prompt": "Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.", "completion": "The floor's on fire! See?!"}
{"prompt": "Try and burn through the ropes.", "completion": "I ought to tell you something."}
{"prompt": "My lucky charm.", "completion": "Feels like a cigarette lighter."}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!", "completion": "What am I looking for?"}
{"prompt": "Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!", "completion": "You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!"}
{"prompt": "Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.", "completion": "So did I."}
{"prompt": "How did you she was a Nazi?", "completion": "She talks in her sleep."}
{"prompt": "She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?", "completion": "Umh?"}
{"prompt": "No! Don't Shoot!", "completion": "Don't worry. He won't."}
{"prompt": "I came here to save you.", "completion": "Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??"}
{"prompt": "Will you take it easy!", "completion": "Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!"}
{"prompt": "Look, can we discuss this later?", "completion": "I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers."}
{"prompt": "Well, uh...", "completion": "You did!!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah?", "completion": "You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?", "completion": "They want my diary."}
{"prompt": "There were rats, Dad.", "completion": "Rats?"}
{"prompt": "No, Dad. You did. Forty years.", "completion": "If only I could have been with you."}
{"prompt": "Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...", "completion": "...you did it."}
{"prompt": "And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?", "completion": "Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy."}
{"prompt": "He was actually there? You saw him?", "completion": "Well, what was left of him."}
{"prompt": "I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?", "completion": "Found it."}
{"prompt": "Through the library?", "completion": "Right."}
{"prompt": "Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.", "completion": "I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs."}
{"prompt": "Dad, they come in through the doors.", "completion": "Good point."}
{"prompt": "No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.", "completion": "Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them."}
{"prompt": "Don't worry -- I'm fine.", "completion": "Thank God!"}
{"prompt": "And the head.  You hit me, Dad!", "completion": "I'll never forgive myself --"}
{"prompt": "I came to get you! What do you think?", "completion": "Oh, it breaks the heart."}
{"prompt": "Don't call me that, please.", "completion": "But what are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Junior!", "completion": "It is you Junior!"}
{"prompt": "Then wait -- count to twenty.", "completion": "No, Dad. You listen to me --"}
{"prompt": "Out!", "completion": "It's important!"}
{"prompt": "I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.", "completion": "Dad!"}
{"prompt": "You're strangely dressed... for a knight.", "completion": "I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "That was seven hundred years ago.", "completion": "A long time to wait."}
{"prompt": "Who are you?", "completion": "The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it."}
{"prompt": "They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.", "completion": "I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me."}
{"prompt": "Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --", "completion": "Where's my father?"}
{"prompt": "No camels!", "completion": "Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?"}
{"prompt": "I don't need camels.", "completion": "But, Indy --"}
{"prompt": "I'm going after those horses.", "completion": "I'll take the camels."}
{"prompt": "That car belonged to my brother-in- law.", "completion": "Come on -- come on!"}
{"prompt": "What happened to Marcus, Sallah?", "completion": "Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them."}
{"prompt": "In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.", "completion": "Get that camel out of the way!"}
{"prompt": "Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?", "completion": "I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father."}
{"prompt": "And why were you trying to kill me?", "completion": "The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe."}
{"prompt": "Who are you?", "completion": "My name is Kazim."}
{"prompt": "All right! Where's my father", "completion": "If you let me go, I will tell you where he is."}
{"prompt": "This is your last chance.", "completion": "No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!"}
{"prompt": "Then we'll die.", "completion": "My soul is prepared. How's yours?"}
{"prompt": "Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!", "completion": "If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die."}
{"prompt": "My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?", "completion": "No."}
{"prompt": "Why are you trying to kill us?", "completion": "Because you're looking for the Holy Grail."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.", "completion": "As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi."}
{"prompt": "Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.", "completion": "Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot."}
{"prompt": "The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.", "completion": "Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century."}
{"prompt": "Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the \"natives\".", "completion": "Just a routine inspection tour."}
{"prompt": "Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.", "completion": "Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?"}
{"prompt": "Miss Scott panicked?", "completion": "When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around."}
{"prompt": "Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...", "completion": "I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me."}
{"prompt": "Something magical. A sacred rock.", "completion": "Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?"}
{"prompt": "No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.", "completion": "I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?"}
{"prompt": "This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.", "completion": "The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive."}
{"prompt": "Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.", "completion": "You're hanging on better here than you did in America."}
{"prompt": "Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.", "completion": "You think so?"}
{"prompt": "Charming.", "completion": "It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him."}
{"prompt": "Interested in local curios?", "completion": "No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta."}
{"prompt": "Who?", "completion": "It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for."}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!"}
{"prompt": "Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --", "completion": "No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --"}
{"prompt": "I believe we're being called to dinner.", "completion": "Finally!"}
{"prompt": "I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.", "completion": "What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!"}
{"prompt": "Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.", "completion": "I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!"}
{"prompt": "His Highness has not yet taken a wife.", "completion": "No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman..."}
{"prompt": "Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!", "completion": "Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?"}
{"prompt": "Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?", "completion": "They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness."}
{"prompt": "He's not exactly what we call \"a spring chicken\".", "completion": "No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father."}
{"prompt": "The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.", "completion": "You should have been there..."}
{"prompt": "Hard to believe, isn't it...?", "completion": "I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot."}
{"prompt": "You understand what he tells us?", "completion": "Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!"}
{"prompt": "Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.", "completion": "Yes, I understand."}
{"prompt": "That was a misunderstanding.", "completion": "Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones."}
{"prompt": "The newspapers exaggerated the incident.", "completion": "And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?"}
{"prompt": "I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...", "completion": "Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist."}
{"prompt": "When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.", "completion": "I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones..."}
{"prompt": "Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.", "completion": "There, you see, Captain. A rock!"}
{"prompt": "You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.", "completion": "Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host."}
{"prompt": "Their stories are just fear and folklore.", "completion": "Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?"}
{"prompt": "There are no stories anymore.", "completion": "Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil."}
{"prompt": "Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.", "completion": "I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard."}
{"prompt": "I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.", "completion": "A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?"}
{"prompt": "We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.", "completion": "I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice."}
{"prompt": "Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.", "completion": "Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?"}
{"prompt": "At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!", "completion": "I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home..."}
{"prompt": "A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.", "completion": "Now what about the antidote, Lao."}
{"prompt": "Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.", "completion": "What's that?"}
{"prompt": "You have insulted my son.", "completion": "Next time I'll cut off more than his finger."}
{"prompt": "So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?", "completion": "Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat."}
{"prompt": "You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.", "completion": "I don't like to show off."}
{"prompt": "Lao She.", "completion": "Nee chin lie how ma?"}
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "Dr. Jones."}
{"prompt": "Read you loud and clear, Indy!", "completion": "Let up on the brake!"}
{"prompt": "Behind you!", "completion": "Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!"}
{"prompt": "Why?", "completion": "Come one, what's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.", "completion": "This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines."}
{"prompt": "The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...", "completion": "Why they glow like that?"}
{"prompt": "What does it mean, Indy?", "completion": "\"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth.\""}
{"prompt": "Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...", "completion": "Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie."}
{"prompt": "He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.", "completion": "Yeah, that's what happened..."}
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!"}
{"prompt": "You don't like him do you?", "completion": "Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?"}
{"prompt": "Just a statue.", "completion": "That little Maharajah think he big stuff."}
{"prompt": "That's it. Pankot Palace.", "completion": "What you look at, Indy?"}
{"prompt": "Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.", "completion": "Indy, look!"}
{"prompt": "It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.", "completion": "I ride with you, Indy?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, Shorty.", "completion": "Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?"}
{"prompt": "Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --", "completion": "Indy?"}
{"prompt": "Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!", "completion": "You got the tickets, Short Round?"}
{"prompt": "Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!", "completion": "Step on it, Short Round!"}
{"prompt": "No, the stones are mine!", "completion": "You're betrayed Shiva."}
{"prompt": "Give me the stones!", "completion": "Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!"}
{"prompt": "That's far enough!", "completion": "You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones."}
{"prompt": "Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.", "completion": "You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer."}
{"prompt": "That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?", "completion": "They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!"}
{"prompt": "Two are still missing.", "completion": "No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs."}
{"prompt": "Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.", "completion": "There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you..."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.", "completion": "You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones."}
{"prompt": "They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.", "completion": "You will find them when you find sivlalinga."}
{"prompt": "And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.", "completion": "But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?"}
{"prompt": "Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.", "completion": "Long ago -- before my father's father."}
{"prompt": "Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --", "completion": "No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us."}
{"prompt": "They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.", "completion": "It is why Krishna brought you here."}
{"prompt": "The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.", "completion": "What evil?"}
{"prompt": "It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.", "completion": "I don't understand. What's happened here?"}
{"prompt": "Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?", "completion": "No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again."}
{"prompt": "Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.", "completion": "You will go to palace there."}
{"prompt": "It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.", "completion": "On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot."}
{"prompt": "Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.", "completion": "You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about."}
{"prompt": "The last Sankara Stone.", "completion": "And they don't even know what it really is."}
{"prompt": "I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.", "completion": "Not quite."}
{"prompt": "Anymore ideas...?", "completion": "Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!"}
{"prompt": "Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!", "completion": "What above the curves?!"}
{"prompt": "I can't!", "completion": "Go!"}
{"prompt": "What're we going to do?!", "completion": "There's got to be another way out."}
{"prompt": "No... they won't kill me.", "completion": "You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you..."}
{"prompt": "Yes, they believe you.", "completion": "I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you."}
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "So now they believe me."}
{"prompt": "I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...", "completion": "Indy? Did you talk to them?"}
{"prompt": "You've got to go to sleep now.", "completion": "I want to go home..."}
{"prompt": "They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...", "completion": "What?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe... someday.  Not today.", "completion": "It's okay. You're all right now."}
{"prompt": "I'm not leaving without those stones.", "completion": "You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!"}
{"prompt": "I'm going down.", "completion": "Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!"}
{"prompt": "Quiet!", "completion": "Wait -- what're you doing?"}
{"prompt": "No... the heart's still beating!", "completion": "Let's go! Let's get out of here!"}
{"prompt": "It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.", "completion": "Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!"}
{"prompt": "Willie!", "completion": "What is it...?"}
{"prompt": "I am -- it looks horrible!", "completion": "Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!"}
{"prompt": "There's a hole! I found a square hole!", "completion": "That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!"}
{"prompt": "A fulcrum release lever!", "completion": "I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!"}
{"prompt": "GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!", "completion": "A what?!"}
{"prompt": "There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!", "completion": "Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!"}
{"prompt": "WILLIE?!", "completion": "I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!"}
{"prompt": "You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.", "completion": "Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!"}
{"prompt": "Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!", "completion": "Oh no -- oh no!!"}
{"prompt": "What -- the bug?", "completion": "Get -- the -- bug -- off!"}
{"prompt": "You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.", "completion": "No -- don't you see -- crawling --"}
{"prompt": "Dr. Jones?", "completion": "Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes..."}
{"prompt": "We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.", "completion": "Don't catch cold."}
{"prompt": "Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?", "completion": "I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie..."}
{"prompt": "You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?", "completion": "You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?"}
{"prompt": "Primitive sexual practices?", "completion": "You're talking to an authority in that area."}
{"prompt": "Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?", "completion": "I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain \"nocturnal activities\" --"}
{"prompt": "You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?", "completion": "Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?"}
{"prompt": "Not leftovers?", "completion": "No -- real food."}
{"prompt": "Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.", "completion": "I've never been so hungry in my life..."}
{"prompt": "That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!", "completion": "Maybe he likes older women."}
{"prompt": "I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.", "completion": "She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub."}
{"prompt": "Any more complaints?", "completion": "Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner..."}
{"prompt": "He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.", "completion": "You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?"}
{"prompt": "Just try and control yourself.", "completion": "He's afraid of something."}
{"prompt": "I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.", "completion": "Couldn't keep away, huh?"}
{"prompt": "You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?", "completion": "I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety."}
{"prompt": "That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?", "completion": "Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers."}
{"prompt": "What does the writing say?", "completion": "It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva."}
{"prompt": "Maybe...", "completion": "The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...", "completion": "Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?"}
{"prompt": "I'd like to find one of those myself.", "completion": "Oh really?"}
{"prompt": "What about the future?", "completion": "Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince."}
{"prompt": "By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?", "completion": "Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that \"a girl could go places in the Orient...\" So, look where I got."}
{"prompt": "Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.", "completion": "He'll be okay. He's a good kid."}
{"prompt": "Where'd you find your little bodyguard?", "completion": "I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!", "completion": "I know the feeling..."}
{"prompt": "It's starting to let go!", "completion": "That's good -- you're doing fine."}
{"prompt": "Keep stroking it!", "completion": "What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!", "completion": "Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!"}
{"prompt": "Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.", "completion": "THE WHAT?!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.", "completion": "PET IT??!!"}
{"prompt": "Can you move your arm?", "completion": "Just one arm!"}
{"prompt": "Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.", "completion": "What?!"}
{"prompt": "Don't let it curl around you!", "completion": "It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!"}
{"prompt": "Don't let it pull you deeper!", "completion": "It's pulling me deeper!"}
{"prompt": "What?!", "completion": "First of all -- don't panic!"}
{"prompt": "Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!", "completion": "Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea."}
{"prompt": "A what...?", "completion": "A SNAKE!!"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?", "completion": "A snake!"}
{"prompt": "Somehow I feel safer in here.", "completion": "Indy! Help me!"}
{"prompt": "Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.", "completion": "Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water."}
{"prompt": "It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...", "completion": "Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now."}
{"prompt": "Their children?", "completion": "What'd he say now?"}
{"prompt": "It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.", "completion": "And then they took their children."}
{"prompt": "That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...", "completion": "Took what?"}
{"prompt": "He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.", "completion": "God, I am starving, but I can't eat this..."}
{"prompt": "The old man saw it in a dream.", "completion": "Dream -- nightmare is more like it."}
{"prompt": "He told me they knew I was coming here.", "completion": "What do you mean -- how?"}
{"prompt": "Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --", "completion": "What'd he say?"}
{"prompt": "No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?", "completion": "India..."}
{"prompt": "Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!", "completion": "You all right?"}
{"prompt": "Oh yeah?", "completion": "Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!"}
{"prompt": "Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?", "completion": "I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me."}
{"prompt": "Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...", "completion": "So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?"}
{"prompt": "I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?", "completion": "Siam."}
{"prompt": "What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!", "completion": "The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!"}
{"prompt": "You don't look very good.", "completion": "Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!"}
{"prompt": "Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!", "completion": "Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?"}
{"prompt": "For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!", "completion": "Relax, I've been giving him lessons."}
{"prompt": "Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!", "completion": "Who cares? Where's that diamond!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, he's not a waiter...", "completion": "No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao."}
{"prompt": "Willie, come on!", "completion": "I like the service here."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to puke in it...", "completion": "I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!"}
{"prompt": "Give me your hat...", "completion": "What for?"}
{"prompt": "Figures...", "completion": "They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them."}
{"prompt": "This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.", "completion": "They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving."}
{"prompt": "I get it!", "completion": "You got it!"}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?", "completion": "Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite."}

{"prompt": "I'll get us out of here.", "completion": "Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two....."}
{"prompt": "I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.", "completion": "Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out."}
{"prompt": "I want to thank you for what you've done.", "completion": "Awwww..."}
{"prompt": "I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.", "completion": "I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done."}
{"prompt": "She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.", "completion": "You're lovely."}
{"prompt": "You're a lucky man.", "completion": "Yeah, sure."}
{"prompt": "She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.", "completion": "They can?"}
{"prompt": "Oh no!", "completion": "I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous."}
{"prompt": "Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.", "completion": "Thing is...I think I'm in love with her."}
{"prompt": "She is beautiful.", "completion": "You've changed your mind."}
{"prompt": "I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.", "completion": "No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along."}

{"prompt": "Rene?", "completion": "She works for them."}

{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "What happened?"}
{"prompt": "Do something.", "completion": "What exactly?"}
{"prompt": "Pretty advanced, isn't it?", "completion": "Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip."}
{"prompt": "This may hurt.", "completion": "Well, don't let it. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "There's a lot you don't know.", "completion": "And don't let her know, either."}
{"prompt": "Dieter!", "completion": "GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho."}
{"prompt": "He aready made the deal..", "completion": "The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now."}

{"prompt": "Are you alright?", "completion": "Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on."}
{"prompt": "I can't handle that thing.", "completion": "Don't worry, I can."}

{"prompt": "He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.", "completion": "Then, why'd he lead us here."}
{"prompt": "It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.", "completion": "And Dieter?"}
{"prompt": "While he makes the run.", "completion": "Where?"}
{"prompt": "It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.", "completion": "He hung us up dry."}

{"prompt": "Not sure at all.", "completion": "Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot."}
{"prompt": "I was afraid of that.", "completion": "You sure this will work?"}
{"prompt": "Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...", "completion": "I've got an idea."}
{"prompt": "It's him.", "completion": "Come on."}
{"prompt": "I don't trust her.", "completion": "Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got..."}
{"prompt": "Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.", "completion": "Probably."}
{"prompt": "I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.", "completion": "No. You can't trust her."}

{"prompt": "Too late.", "completion": "What next!"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry!", "completion": "...drink it."}
{"prompt": "I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.", "completion": "Don't touch a thing."}
{"prompt": "I told you, I have a feeling...", "completion": "One of your instincts?"}
{"prompt": "You think. That's what you're good at.", "completion": "Yeah...You've fallen for her."}
{"prompt": "It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.", "completion": "What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through."}
{"prompt": "Relax. Let me do this.", "completion": "Relax. Make your mind a blank."}
{"prompt": "`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.", "completion": "What do I do?"}
{"prompt": "Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.", "completion": "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone..."}
{"prompt": "Just stay here and rest.", "completion": "Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "That's not funny.", "completion": "Sapporo.."}
{"prompt": "I can't keep up.", "completion": "Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad."}
{"prompt": "Run, stupid!", "completion": "Come on, she's getting away."}
{"prompt": "Follow her.", "completion": "On what?"}
{"prompt": "I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........", "completion": "What do I do?"}
{"prompt": "Don't you think I stand out like this.", "completion": "We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself."}
{"prompt": "Osaka?", "completion": "Fountainhead of High-Tech."}
{"prompt": "That's good. It's not better. Where?", "completion": "Osaka."}
{"prompt": "You found her.", "completion": "Better. I found Ryuji."}

{"prompt": "It wasn't like that.", "completion": "Some agent you are."}
{"prompt": "I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!", "completion": "You been had. We have."}
{"prompt": "No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?", "completion": "No. What will you do."}
{"prompt": "It's not your time. I get time off.", "completion": "You get time off to sleep."}
{"prompt": "Shit! You're in love.", "completion": "And on my time."}

{"prompt": "It's embarrassing.", "completion": "What if she says something important?"}
{"prompt": "What is it?", "completion": "You can't listen. You can't watch either."}
{"prompt": "You're doing great with her.", "completion": "Not her. You!"}
{"prompt": "What is it, your charm?", "completion": "This just won't work."}
{"prompt": "Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.", "completion": "Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct..."}
{"prompt": "She's the toughest to read.", "completion": "Maybe she's telling the truth."}

{"prompt": "He recognises you, throw him off.", "completion": "My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place."}
{"prompt": "I don't know what's going on.", "completion": "It lends you an air of mystery."}
{"prompt": "Killer!", "completion": "Just don't show fear."}
